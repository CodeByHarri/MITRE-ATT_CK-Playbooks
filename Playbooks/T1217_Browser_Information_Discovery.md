| Log Sources to Investigate | To identify Browser Information Discovery, focus on monitoring logs related to file access and process execution. Relevant logs include:<br>- Endpoint detection logs to track access to directories such as '%APPDATA%/Google/Chrome/%' or '%LOCALAPPDATA%/Mozilla/Firefox/%'.<br>- File access logs that record events involving the reading or writing of browser-related files (e.g., history, bookmarks, login data).<br>- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) logs that correlate user access patterns.<br>- Application logs if available, related to browser extensions and plugins.<br>- Authentication logs that can reveal suspicious login attempts corresponding with browser activity. |
| Key Indicators | Indicators of browser information discovery activity include:<br>- Unusual access to browser data directories (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).<br>- Execution of non-browser processes reading browser profile data.<br>- Network connections being established by processes typically not associated with network activity.<br>- Abnormal user agent strings or browser type inconsistencies within environments.<br>- Unexpected modifications or accesses to browser settings or data files. |
| Questions for Analysis | Questions to help determine the legitimacy of the detection might include:<br>- Has the user recently installed or updated their browser or a related extension?<br>- Is there a legitimate system or application update process that could account for the observed activity?<br>- Are the processes accessing browser data commonly used within normal business operations?<br>- Was there a successful login from an unusual or foreign location prior to this discovery activity? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if:<br>- There is confirmation that the accessing process or user account does not usually interact with browser profile data.<br>- The activity is correlated with credential access or exfiltration attempts.<br>- Multiple endpoints show similar suspicious indicators that can't be attributed to normal behavior.<br>- Login anomalies coincide with browser data access events. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Verify any recent software or browser updates that would lead to accessing browser data.<br>2. Check the user account activity for any unusual login patterns.<br>3. Cross-reference the process names and signatures accessing browser files against known threats.<br>4. Look up any discovered indicators (file paths, process names) in threat intelligence resources. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Conduct deeper analysis of the discovered processes, including file hash comparisons and identifying parent processes.<br>2. Use endpoint threat detection tools to analyze the behavior of the suspicious processes.<br>3. Validate the scope of the issue by determining if other systems exhibit similar behaviors.<br>4. Provide threat hunting guidance to identify potential lateral movement or additional compromise points. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further data access or exfiltration.<br>2. Initiate a review of compromised browser profiles and reset passwords for any affected accounts.<br>3. Update endpoint protection rules to detect and alert on similar activity in the future.<br>4. Conduct a full sweep of the environment to identify any other compromises and understand potential entry points used by the adversaries. |
