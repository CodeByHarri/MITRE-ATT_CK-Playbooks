| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate logs from boot records and partition changes, including but not limited to system event logs, security event logs, network monitoring tools, and endpoint detection and response (EDR) logs. Also consider log sources from host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS) and network intrusion detection systems (NIDS). Specific examples include Windows Event Logs related to disk management, Linux syslogs referencing disk utility commands, and logs from tools like Sysinternals Suite (e.g., Sysmon) capturing changes to MBR or partition tables. |
| Key Indicators | Key indicators include detection of unauthorized changes to the master boot record or partition table, unexpected system reboots, presence of malware with capabilities to overwrite boot records, abnormal disk format commands appearing in logs, and network traffic suggesting propagation behavior (e.g., excessive connections to administrative shares). Additionally, specific command lines such as 'format', 'fdisk', or low-level disk writing utilities unexpected on the system are relevant indicators. |
| Questions for Analysis | Is there evidence of unauthorized modification of boot records or partition tables? Are there occurrences of uncommon or unauthorized disk commands such as 'format' in the logs? Has there been a report of sudden system unavailability or failure to boot? Are there any ongoing incidents reported in other parts of the network suggesting propagation of similar issues? Is known destructive malware such as Shamoon or StoneDrill involved? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if there is confirmed unauthorized modification to critical disk structures, or if there is a pattern of similar modifications across multiple systems. Escalate also if there is suspected involvement of worm-like malware, or if initial analysis identifies a notable threat actor or campaign activity related to this TTP. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | For L1, verify the integrity and recent changes of the master boot record or partition table using disk analysis tools. Cross-reference recent disk activity logs with authorized network activity approvals. Gather context around any reported system reboots or availability issues. Document all findings concisely for faster escalation and analysis. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct in-depth examination of forensic disk images if available. Analyze network flow data for signs of malware propagation. Correlate discovered indicators with threat intelligence feeds to identify potential threat actor attributions or ongoing campaigns. Investigate secured logs for connections to and from administrative shares. Compile findings in a detailed report outlining severity and spread of the threat. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Isolate affected systems upon identification to prevent further damage or propagation. Restore systems from secure backups if integrity is compromised. Apply host-based firewalls to block suspicious connections. Enhance logging and monitoring for MBR/partition manipulation activities. Collaborate with development to update security protocols preventing similar intrusions. Consider deploying network segmentation to contain lateral movement. |
