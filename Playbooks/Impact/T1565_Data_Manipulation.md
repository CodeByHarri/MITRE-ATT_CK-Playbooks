| Name | Data Manipulation |
| Log Sources to Investigate | File integrity monitoring logs (e.g., Tripwire) to detect unauthorized changes to critical files, application logs to trace data modification operations within specific applications, database audit logs to track changes to database records or schema, and network traffic logs to identify suspicious data movement patterns. Examples include SQL server logs, ERP system logs, and web application logs. |
| Key Indicators | Unusual patterns of file updates or deletions in critical directories, unexpected SQL queries or data manipulation commands, modification of database schemas without change management records, unusual access patterns indicating potential data tampering (e.g., multiple failed login attempts followed by a successful login and modification activity), and discrepancies between system logs and actual data state. |
| Questions for Analysis | Were there any recorded modifications to critical data elements after normal business hours? Do logs indicate any unauthorized access or privilege escalation prior to the data modification activity? Are there any discrepancies between database log records and actual data contents? Is there a pattern of access or modification that can be linked to user accounts or IP addresses that are not typically associated with such activities? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if there is evidence of unauthorized data alteration, if the affected data is sensitive or critical to business operations, or if there are indications of related suspicious activities (e.g., privilege escalation). Also escalate if there is a lack of change management records for significant data changes or multiple users are affected, suggesting potential widespread impact. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify the source and legitimacy of data modification requests within the logs by cross-referencing with change management records. Identify any commonality between recent data modification events and current cybersecurity alerts. Check for concurrent anomalies in network traffic or user behaviors that might indicate compromised accounts or lateral movement. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct a deeper analysis of the identified suspicious activities, correlating them with known threat intelligence. Work with IT to compare backed-up data with current data for detecting unauthorized changes. Utilize specialized forensic tools to reconstruct the timeline of events leading to the alteration and identify potential malware or compromised user accounts involved. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Isolate affected systems if necessary to prevent further data manipulation. Implement immediate access restrictions on suspicious accounts. Coordinate with the IT team to perform a full system scan for malware and unauthorized software that could facilitate data manipulation. Review and strengthen data governance and access control policies to prevent future occurrences of similar incidents. |
