| Name | Account Access Removal |
| Log Sources to Investigate | 1. Windows Event Logs: Check for Security Event ID 4720 (User Account Created), 4722 (User Account Enabled), 4725 (User Account Disabled), 4726 (User Account Deleted), 4740 (A user account was locked out), and 4781 (Password set to never expire) for any suspicious account activity.<br>2. PowerShell Logs: Review ScriptBlockLogging and ModuleLogging events for the use of Set-LocalUser and Set-ADAccountPassword cmdlets.<br>3. Active Directory Logs: Monitor for changes to user accounts, especially any unauthorized modifications. 4. NetFlow or similar network monitoring: Look for unauthorized remote access or network anomalies correlating with account changes. 5. Audit logs from PAM solutions, if deployed: To identify potentially unauthorized administrative actions on accounts. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Unexpected account deletions or modifications during non-business hours.<br>2. Usage of administrative tools (e.g., Net utility, PowerShell) by non-IT personnel.<br>3. Failed login attempts followed by account disablement. 4. Accounts with sudden changes to membership in privileged groups. 5. Repeated password changes within a short timeframe for critical accounts. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Was the account modification action performed by a known and authorized user?<br>2. Did the time of the action coincide with normal business hours or any pre-approved maintenance windows?<br>3. Are there any correlated alerts indicating potential malicious activity around the same timeframe? 4. Are there any open incidents or prior suspicious activities involving the affected accounts or systems? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if any of the following conditions are met: 1. Unauthorized account modifications are confirmed.<br>2. Accounts with critical or privileged access were targeted.<br>3. Anomalous activity occurs alongside data destruction or encryption alerts. 4. Actions are observed from external or unexpected IP addresses. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Correlate the detected activity with user access patterns and business hours to determine if the activity is anomalous.<br>2. Review any associated incident history for the impacted systems or accounts.<br>3. Verify the legitimacy of account modifications by cross-referencing with change management records or contacting the account owner/manager. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Conduct a deeper analysis of the affected accounts to identify any further unauthorized changes.<br>2. Investigate related system logs to uncover possible initial access vectors or lateral movement.<br>3. Coordinate with IT teams to check for any unauthorized physical access or misconfigurations. 4. Utilize SIEM to identify patterns in account status changes across the enterprise. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Temporarily disable affected accounts to prevent further unauthorized access.<br>2. Ensure robust backup systems are in place, and recent snapshots are secure.<br>3. Identify and remove persistence mechanisms if introduced. 4. Initiate a thorough review of account policies and enforce stricter access controls, updating them as necessary. 5. Conduct a post-incident review to update response plans and techniques. |
