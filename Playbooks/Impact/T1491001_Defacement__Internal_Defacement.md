| Name | Defacement: Internal Defacement |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate web server logs and endpoint logs for unusual activity. Specifically, review HTTP request logs for unusual POST or PUT requests that may indicate unauthorized content changes. Examine endpoint security logs for changes in desktop wallpapers or other visual elements. Check for anomalies in the access logs of internal CMS or file servers. Examples may include changes in access patterns or elevated privileges being used outside of normal change management processes. |
| Key Indicators | Unusual modifications to internal website content or desktop wallpapers on user workstations. The presence of disturbing or unexpected content served through internal web platforms. Indicators of unauthorized file access or modifications, such as non-standard HTTP methods (e.g., PUT/DELETE) used towards internal web servers or CMS. Suspicious user activity such as administrative actions performed by non-admin users, particularly involving web content. |
| Questions for Analysis | Are there any logs showing unexpected changes to web content or desktop settings? Have any unauthorized users been detected making changes to server or endpoint configurations? Were there any external IP addresses involved in internal content modification processes? Is there any indication that the changes correlate with any known threat actor TTPs? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if you identify unauthorized modifications to internal web content or desktop settings that align with known threat patterns or tactics. Additionally, escalate if there are indicators of compromised user accounts being used in the process, or if offensive or unusual images/content appear on multiple endpoints simultaneously. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Review firewall and proxy logs for any suspicious outbound connections that may correlate with the attack timeline. Verify recent user account activities and permissions changes to check for accounts behaving anomalously. Confirm whether there are backups of the affected systems and verify their integrity. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Perform deep forensic analysis on affected systems to trace any unauthorized accesses. Correlate any detected anomalies with threat intelligence data to identify overlap with known adversary behaviors. Utilize endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to examine any additional system modifications or to identify persistence mechanisms. Collaborate with IT teams to evaluate potential impacts on system and network integrity. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Isolate affected systems to prevent further unauthorized modifications. Restore defaced systems from authentic backups if available and ensure no persistence mechanisms are in place. Conduct a comprehensive security review across the network to identify any further compromise. Increase monitoring for similar activities on other parts of the network and implement enhanced web and endpoint security controls. |
