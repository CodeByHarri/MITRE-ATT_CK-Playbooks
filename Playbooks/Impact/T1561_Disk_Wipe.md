| Name | Disk Wipe |
| Log Sources to Investigate | 1. Disk activity logs: Monitor raw disk write operations to identify unusual or unauthorized disk write commands or patterns. Examples: Windows Event Logs (specifically NTFS), Sysmon Disk Operation events. <br>2. File Integrity Monitoring: Use tools to check for changes in critical disk structures such as the master boot record (MBR) or partition tables. <br>3. Network traffic logs: Look for unusual SMB traffic or signs of worm-like propagation across networks as adversaries attempt to spread using Valid Accounts or Admin Shares. Example: Packet captures or NetFlow data.<br>4. Authentication logs: Monitor for unusual login attempts or successful logins using OS Credential Dumping techniques. Examples: Windows Security Logs, PAM logs on Linux. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Unusual disk write commands targeting large or critical disk areas without corresponding legitimate application behavior.<br>2. Modifications to the master boot record (MBR) or other boot/system partitions.<br>3. Rapid spread of similar malicious files across multiple hosts, indicating worm-like behavior.<br>4. Unusual or multiple logon events consistent with lateral movement through Valid Accounts.<br>5. Execution of 'erase' commands on network devices via Network Device CLI logs. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Is there any evidence of unauthorized or unexpected disk write operations on critical systems?<br>2. Are there signs of anomalous or unauthorized access to network shares or accounts?<br>3. Have there been any recent changes to the MBR or other important disk structures?<br>4. What are the sources and destinations of the suspicious network activity? Are they typical for the network environment?<br>5. Is the 'erase' command usage consistent with regular administrative patterns, or is it occurring from unusual sources or at unusual times? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if: <br>1. There is confirmed unauthorized modification of the MBR or significant disk sectors.<br>2. Detection of worm-like behavior with new or unknown files propagating across the network.<br>3. Unusual authentication attempts that suggest OS Credential Dumping or use of Valid Accounts.<br>4. Network device configurations or data erased using unauthorized CLI commands. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Verify disk activity against known good activities or baselines to determine anomaly.<br>2. Correlate network traffic logs with authentication logs to identify potential lateral movement.<br>3. Review system logs for signs of script execution or direct disk access tools.<br>4. Cross-reference identified disk-wiping tools against existing threat intelligence feeds. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of compromised or suspected systems to confirm the presence of disk wiping malware.<br>2. Use network and endpoint forensic tools to trace the propagation path and initial foothold of the malware.<br>3. Identify all compromised accounts and reset credentials to prevent further access.<br>4. If possible, obtain a sample of the malware for reverse engineering and further Threat Intelligence development. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further spread of the malware.<br>2. Employ backup recovery procedures to restore critical data and system functions.<br>3. Patch vulnerable systems and apply authentication controls to limit unauthorized access.<br>4. Update security defenses to detect similar threat patterns in the future. <br>5. Communicate with incident response teams to refine containment and eradication strategies across the network. |
