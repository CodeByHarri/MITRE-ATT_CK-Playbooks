| Log Sources to Investigate | File system auditing logs, including file creation, modification, and access events. Look for logs from tools that capture NTFS attributes, particularly events related to the `$STANDARD_INFORMATION` and `$FILE_NAME` attributes. Security event logs on Windows, focusing on file operations by unusual or unauthorized users. Output from forensic analysis tools that monitor or report on timestomping indicators. Examples: Windows Event Logs (Event IDs 4663 for file access, 5145 for file operations over the network), File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) logs. |
| Key Indicators | Discrepancies between `$STANDARD_INFORMATION` and `$FILE_NAME` timestamps within NTFS metadata. Timestamps that significantly deviate from known activity patterns, such as older timestamps for newly created or modified files. Logs showing API calls or tool usage that modify file attributes by suspicious or unauthorized programs (e.g., use of 'SetFileTime' function). Suspected timestomping identified in forensic analysis reports. |
| Questions for Analysis | Are there any timestamp discrepancies between `$SI` and `$FN` attributes? Are modified files associated with unusual or unauthorized processes/users? Is there a pattern or correlation between the timestamps of known legitimate files and the suspicious ones? Have similar events been observed on the endpoint or network previously? Are there any indicators of masquerading in conjunction with timestomping? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if: Detected timestamp discrepancies cannot be explained by normal operations. The analysis shows repeated or patterned behavior possibly indicating broader compromise. Suspected involvement of critical or sensitive systems. Any correlation with known threat actor tactics, techniques, or procedures (TTPs). |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify the source and legitimacy of files with altered timestamps. Identify other actions performed by the user or process modifying these attributes. Check for additional artifacts of misuse or compromise in the system or network logs. Use available threat intelligence to correlate the suspicious behavior with known threats. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Perform deeper forensic analysis on files/folders with timestamp anomalies. Use advanced tools to assess any kernel-level modification or double timestomping tactics. Investigate potential lateral movement or broader compromise indicators in the environment. Coordinate with incident response teams if signs of a wider attack are identified. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Isolate affected systems and halt any suspicious processes. Restore affected files from backup if integrity cannot be ensured. Implement stricter file monitoring and audit policies. Conduct a full network and endpoint sweep to check for related indicators of compromise. Document findings and share with threat intelligence or incident response teams for continuous improvement of detection and response processes. |
