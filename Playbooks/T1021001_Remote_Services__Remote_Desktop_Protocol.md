| Name | Remote Services: Remote Desktop Protocol |
| Log Sources to Investigate | 1. Windows Security Logs: Check for Event ID 4624 (An account was successfully logged on) with special focus on Logon Type 10 (indicating a remote interactive logon via RDP).<br>2. Firewall Logs: Inspect for unusual RDP connection attempts from unfamiliar or external IP addresses.<br>3. Authentication Logs: Review network and system logs for failed login attempts that could indicate a brute force attack prior to successful RDP login.<br>4. RDP Connection Logs: Look for Event IDs like 1149 (RDP connection attempt).<br>5. Network Traffic Logs: Analyze for unusual or large RDP traffic patterns or attempts from unexpected geographic locations. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Unusual login times or logins from new geographic locations.<br>2. Multiple login failures followed by a successful login using RDP.<br>3. New or unrecognized devices connecting via RDP.<br>4. High volume of connections on the RDP port (default 3389) from a specific IP.<br>5. Use of accounts that normally do not use RDP for remote connections. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Is the detected RDP login attempt from a recognized or expected IP address?<br>2. Were there prior failed logon attempts before a successful one?<br>3. Does the account normally use RDP for access?<br>4. Is the login occurring outside normal business hours or operational patterns?<br>5. Have any credentials recently been reported compromised or suspected to be compromised? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if: <br>1. RDP login is from an unrecognized IP or geographic location.<br>2. There are multiple failed attempts leading to a successful login.<br>3. Accounts with privileged access are used unexpectedly.<br>4. RDP logins coincide with other suspicious activities (e.g., file modifications, network scanning). |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Verify the legitimacy of the IP address and location from which the RDP access was attempted.<br>2. Cross-reference with known or whitelisted applications to identify potential legitimate usage.<br>3. Confirm whether the account is being used by its true owner or has recent compromised activity reported. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Perform a detailed investigation into the context and timeline of RDP usage.<br>2. Review the activities performed post-login for any suspicious command execution or data exfiltration.<br>3. Correlate with other security events to identify potential lateral movement within the network.<br>4. Investigate any changes in accessibility features or DLL persistence mechanisms. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. If unauthorized, immediately disconnect the session and triage the system for further forensic investigation.<br>2. Reset credentials of any compromised accounts observed.<br>3. Update firewall rules to restrict RDP access from unauthorized or suspicious IP ranges.<br>4. Implement MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) for remote access to mitigate future risk.<br>5. Review and harden RDP security configurations, such as disabling unused remote access accounts and enforcing network-level authentication. |
