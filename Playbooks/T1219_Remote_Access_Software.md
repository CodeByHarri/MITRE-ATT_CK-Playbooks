| Name | Remote Access Software |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate process creation logs, especially for processes related to known remote access tools such as VNC, TeamViewer, AnyDesk, ScreenConnect, LogMeIn, AmmyyAdmin, and Google Chrome Remote Desktop. Review network traffic logs for unusual outgoing connections, particularly those establishing connections over ports typically used by these tools. Analyze Windows Event Logs for service creation events (indicative of persistence mechanisms) and authentication logs to spot any suspicious or unusual logins that coincide with these remote tools' use. |
| Key Indicators | Presence of executables associated with remote access tools on systems where they are not pre-installed or expected (e.g., 'TeamViewer.exe', 'AnyDesk.exe'). Unusual outbound network traffic to IP addresses that are not part of usual business operations, especially on ports associated with remote access. Unexpected Windows Service creation related to names of remote access tools. Repeated failed login attempts followed by remote access software execution. |
| Questions for Analysis | Is the remote access software installation authorized and approved by IT? Are there corresponding user activities that align with expected business needs? Is there evidence of lateral movement after the installation of the remote access software? Is there an ongoing or previous incident report involving similar indicators? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if the remote access software is detected on a high-value asset or system with sensitive information without prior authorization. Escalate if there is concurrent suspicious network activity or if there are signs of privilege escalation, lateral movement, or new account/service creation tied to the presence of remote access software. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify the legitimacy of the installed remote access tool by cross-referencing with asset inventory and authorized software lists. Check endpoint protection logs for detected anomalies related to remote access tools. Review user activity and behavior logs concurrent with the installation and execution timestamps of the remote access software. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct a deeper network analysis to look for patterns that match known C2 techniques associated with the software used. Correlate with threat intelligence feeds to find if any IPs or domains associated with command and control are being contacted. Validate findings by comparing with baseline network activity logs. Check for additional persistence mechanisms such as abnormal registry changes or scheduled tasks. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | If unauthorized, isolate the affected system from the network. Uninstall the unauthorized remote access tool. Conduct a full memory and disk forensic analysis to identify how the software was installed and trace adversary behavior. Update firewall and endpoint monitoring rules to block unauthorized remote access attempts. Notify relevant stakeholders and conduct a broader sweep of the network to identify any other instances of unauthorized installation or execution. |
