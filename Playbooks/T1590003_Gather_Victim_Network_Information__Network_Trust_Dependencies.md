| Name | Gather Victim Network Information: Network Trust Dependencies |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Network traffic monitoring logs to detect unexpected connections or data transfers to third-party domains. DNS logs for queries related to third-party services or uncommon domains. Security incident and event management (SIEM) platforms for alerts related to unusual activity patterns. Active directory access logs to detect unusual AD trust changes or access attempts. Cloud provider logs if leveraged by the organization, for unauthorized API calls or resource access. |
| Key Indicators | Unusual outbound connections to third-party networks or domains. DNS requests to domains not commonly queried by the organization. Unexplained changes in network trust configurations, such as modifications to AD trust setups. Access requests from unexpected or unrecognized external source IP addresses. Anomalies in user activity logs such as accessing unfamiliar network resources or partners. |
| Questions for Analysis | Is there a legitimate business reason for communication with the detected third-party network/domain? Have similar events been observed in recent history that were deemed legitimate? Are the DNS queries aligned with expected organizational patterns? Do the changes in network trust or AD setup align with scheduled IT activities? Are there known engagements with the entities represented by the domain/IP responding? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if there are multiple indicators of compromise, such as a combination of suspicious DNS queries and network connections. Escalate if there are changes to network trust configurations without corresponding change requests or documentation. If initial analysis cannot determine the legitimacy of the observed connections or actions, or if confirmed data leakage seems possible, escalate to Tier 2. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify the domains and IPs with threat intelligence feeds for known malicious activity. Check internal documentation and logs for scheduled IT maintenance or business engagements with detected third-party entities. Conduct a preliminary correlation of events to understand potential relationships. Consult with IT/network teams to verify any legitimate changes to network trusts. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Perform deeper network traffic analysis to trace the connection origin and destination specifics. Utilize threat intelligence platforms for context regarding any suspicious domains or IPs. Conduct user behavior analytics to determine if the account(s) involved have previous associations with such activity. Engage with internal departments or partners to verify the necessity and legitimacy of detected connections. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Isolate systems engaged in suspicious communications if confidence in malicious activity is high. Advise to change network trust configurations if unnecessary or unauthorized trusts are discovered. Implement immediate network segmentation strategies to prevent lateral movement. Recommend monitoring enhancements and custom threat hunting for similar anomalies across the network. Advise on incident response policy review and update based on findings. |
