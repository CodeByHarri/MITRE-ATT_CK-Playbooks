| Name | Credentials from Password Stores: Password Managers |
| Log Sources to Investigate | 1. Application Logs: Look for logs of password manager applications to check for suspicious access patterns or failed login attempts. Examples include LastPass, KeePass, and 1Password logs.<br>2. Memory Analysis: Use tools like Volatility to check for processes or threads that may have loaded or copied credentials from memory.<br>3. File Access Logs: Monitor logs that track access to encrypted databases such as audit logs from filesystem monitoring solutions. 4. Authentication Logs: Review authentication attempts on systems hosting password managers for unusual access patterns. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Multiple failed login attempts to password manager applications indicating potential brute force attacks.<br>2. Evidence of unexpected process injection or the spawning of new, suspicious processes related to password managers.<br>3. Unusual access times to password manager databases or files, especially if occurring outside normal business hours. 4. Direct access to memory regions known to contain password manager data without corresponding legitimate access attempts. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Are there any legitimate reasons or justifications for the credential access attempts logged?<br>2. Do the source IP addresses or user accounts correlate with known authorized users?<br>3. Is there a history of similar events involving the same user account or machine? 4. Were there any recent security alerts or vulnerabilities reported on the system components involved? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if: 1. There is confirmation of a successful extraction of credentials not attributed to legitimate user activity.<br>2. Unusual access patterns cannot be explained by standard operational behavior.<br>3. User or IP behavior is flagged as anomalous by threat intelligence feeds. 4. Attempts are detected continuously or across multiple endpoints, indicating potential coordinated activity. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Verify if the password managers in use are up to date and check if any recent vulnerabilities might have been exploited.<br>2. Review network traffic logs for unusual outbound connections potentially exfiltrating data from the affected host.<br>3. Correlate unusual login attempts with physical access logs or badge reader data if available to determine insider threats. 4. Check if there are any known signatures of tools like KeeThief involved in the detected activity. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of affected systems for malicious scripts or tools used in the credential extraction.<br>2. Check for concurrent activities across other potential targets within the network to assess the scope of the attack.<br>3. Collaborate with IT to reset passwords and reinforce password policies on potentially compromised accounts. 4. Engage with threat intelligence sources to update detection rules based on newer tactics and signatures. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Immediately isolate systems showing evidence of compromised password managers from the network.<br>2. Implement enhanced monitoring on affected systems and accounts to quickly detect further suspicious activities.<br>3. Encourage affected users to change the master passwords of their password managers and notify management of possible credential compromise. 4. Review and update incident response plans to reflect lessons learned and improve future readiness against similar attacks. |
