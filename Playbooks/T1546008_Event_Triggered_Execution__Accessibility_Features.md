| Name | Event Triggered Execution: Accessibility Features |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Monitor Windows Event Logs, specifically Security (event ID 4688), System, and Application. File integrity monitoring should be enabled on C:\Windows\System32 directory to detect changes. Check logs from endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions for suspicious activities such as unexpected command executions. Utilize registry tracking to monitor changes to known accessibility program paths (e.g., sethc.exe, utilman.exe, osk.exe, etc.). Log entries from Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) sessions should be reviewed as attacks may occur over RDP. |
| Key Indicators | Unusual process initiation from C:\Windows\System32\ (e.g., execution of cmd.exe or other unauthorized executables in place of accessibility tools), modification or tampering logs for binaries like sethc.exe or utilman.exe, abnormal registry key changes pointing to altered executable paths for accessibility features, command line arguments initiating unexpected programs from the login screen detected in event logs or EDR alerts. |
| Questions for Analysis | Were there any unauthorized changes made to C:\Windows\System32\ folder or registry keys associated with accessibility applications? Are there any logs indicating administrative actions without proper user approval or during odd hours? Were there any unusual RDP logins correlating to these changes? Does the new binary have a valid digital signature? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if there are confirmed changes to binary files in C:\Windows\System32\ without proper patching records or user-initiated updates, unauthorized registry changes detected, any indication of command executions at the login screen that can't be logically explained, or if suspicious patterns correlate across log sources (e.g., RDP and file changes). |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify the digital signature of suspected modified binary files. Review recent system update logs to ensure no official updates could have caused the changes. Check for presence of known malicious hashes for the binaries in question. Cross-reference file changes with software deployment logs to eliminate false positives. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct in-depth file analysis of any replaced binaries for malicious signatures. Review full logging data from the period leading up to the change. Investigate any correlating suspicious network activity, such as suspicious IP addresses interacting with the system during this time. Pull historical records of system access requests and approvals. Use sandbox techniques to safely execute suspected binaries and observe behavior. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Isolate affected systems from the network to prevent lateral movement. Restore original accessibility files from backup if tampering is confirmed. Conduct a thorough sweep on all user workstations for similar unauthorized changes. Engage digital forensic specialists to analyze potentially malicious code. Implement additional monitoring on top of preventive measures, like blocking RDP from unauthorized hosts, and enforcing strict signature checks on executable files. |
