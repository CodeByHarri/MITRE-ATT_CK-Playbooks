| Log Sources to Investigate | To effectively investigate T1125 - Video Capture, analysts should focus on the following log sources: <br>1. **System Logs**: Check for logs from the operating system related to camera access or usage, especially access granted logs. <br>2. **Application Logs**: Review logs from video conferencing or camera applications for unexpected or unauthorized access attempts. <br>3. **File Creation Logs**: Monitor directories commonly used for storing video files (e.g., user video directories) for new file creation. <br>4. **Process Execution Logs**: Investigate any processes that interact with the webcam or camera peripherals, particularly those not typically associated with legitimate applications (e.g., cmd, PowerShell on Windows, bash on macOS/Linux). |
| Key Indicators | 1. **Unexpected Webcam Activation**: Detection of the webcam or video device being activated without the user's knowledge or consent. <br>2. **New Video File Creation**: Sudden appearance of large video files in user directories, especially in hidden or non-standard locations. <br>3. **Suspicious Access to Camera APIs**: Processes accessing camera APIs without proper permissions or outside normal usage patterns. <br>4. **Malware Signatures**: Known malware signatures or hashes, such as FruitFly or Proton, detected on the system. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Is there evidence of the webcam or video hardware being accessed or activated recently? <br>2. Are there any known files or processes associated with video capture malware present on the system? <br>3. Have there been any user reports or alerts associated with camera usage or video file creation? <br>4. Has there been any unusual network activity indicating possible exfiltration of video data? |
| Decision for Escalation | Immediate escalation to Tier 2 is necessary if any of the following are observed: <br>1. Webcam activation during non-working hours or when no legitimate use is identified. <br>2. Detection of known video capture malware artifacts such as FruitFly or Proton. <br>3. Presence of unusual or unauthorized access to camera-related APIs by non-standard processes. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Verify webcam access patterns against user activity logs to validate legitimacy. <br>2. Cross-reference process IDs accessing camera APIs with known trustful executables. <br>3. Conduct a basic file integrity check on video storage folders to identify anomalies. <br>4. Conduct initial contact tracing of video files (e.g., timestamps, file size) for irregularities. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Perform a deep-dive analysis of all processes that accessed camera API logs. <br>2. Investigate network traffic for signs of data exfiltration, specifically outbound traffic when video was captured. <br>3. Conduct a thorough malware analysis if suspicious files or processes are identified. <br>4. Coordinate with endpoint protection teams to implement additional monitoring or patches as necessary. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Immediately isolate the system from the network to prevent further exfiltration if unauthorized webcam or video recording is confirmed. <br>2. Remove any identified malware using up-to-date AV tools and conduct a subsequent system scan. <br>3. Reset permissions or disable access to camera devices for applications without legitimate need. <br>4. Review system logs and develop detection rules or alerts for future occurrences of similar activity. |
