| Name | Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion |
| Log Sources to Investigate | The primary log sources to investigate for Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion (T1497) include: 1) Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) logs, which can capture process execution and anomalies related to virtualization checks, 2) Network traffic logs, particularly those from network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), which might show unusual network activity or connections, 3) System event logs, focusing on unexpected software or script executions that check for virtualization or analysis tools, 4) Security information and event management (SIEM) systems, aggregating suspicious indicators from various sources. Example logs to scrutinize include system calls checking for virtual drivers or process execution logs indicating the presence of sleep intervals in malware code. |
| Key Indicators | Key indicators of this TTP include: 1) Execution of processes or scripts that attempt to detect virtualization-related artifacts such as hypervisor files, registry keys, or system characteristics (e.g., 'vmtoolsd.exe'), 2) Detection of security analysis tools such as Sysinternals, Wireshark, or sandbox identifiers like 'sandboxie', 3) Abnormally delayed execution resulting from sleep timer instructions implemented by malware to evade quick sandbox analysis, 4) Network logs showing connections to suspicious domains post-detection of a virtualized environment. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1) Does the executed process or script show behavior consistent with known virtualization checks or sandbox evasion techniques?<br>2) Are there any signs of this activity being legitimate, such as associated legitimate business applications?<br>3) Is there corroborating evidence in network traffic that suggests post-sandbox-check activity, such as command-and-control communications? 4) Is there any evidence of user activity around the time of process execution indicating potential false positives? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if: 1) The process or script behavior is consistent with known evasion techniques and cannot be immediately tied to legitimate applications, 2) There is evidence of changes in malware behavior post-detection of virtual environments, 3) Accompanying network indicators such as suspicious domain access are detected in conjunction with sandbox evasion tactics, 4) Multiple failed or successful attempts to gather and react to system environment data without user initiation. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1) Correlate execution timestamps of processes or systems with network logs to identify patterns or connections to malicious activities.<br>2) Verify if the same behavior has been observed in other systems within the organization to assess the potential spread or scope.<br>3) Check external threat intelligence sources for similar indicators of compromise. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1) Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of the system, including memory and disk analysis to uncover hidden or dormant malware possibly altered to avoid detection.<br>2) Analyze the full stack of network packet captures (PCAPs) for any C2 communication patterns following sandbox detection.<br>3) Perform an in-depth review of registry and file changes to determine the breadth of initial access and lateral movement strategies based on evasion success. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1) Isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.<br>2) Execute malware analysis in a controlled environment to assess its full capabilities and potential payloads.<br>3) Implement stricter monitoring and logging on all systems suspected of being targeted with evasion attempts. 4) Patch and update any vulnerable applications or systems that could facilitate such evasion techniques. 5) Consider deploying enhanced security measures such as updated sandboxes and VM detection techniques to counter such TTPs in the future. |
