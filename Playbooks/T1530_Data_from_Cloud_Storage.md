| Log Sources to Investigate | Cloud provider audit logs such as AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Logs, and Google Cloud Logging are essential to monitor access patterns to cloud storage solutions. Relevant log entries include suspicious API calls to list or download storage objects. SaaS application logs including Office 365 Unified Audit Log or Google Workspace Admin Logs can also reveal access to cloud-based document services like OneDrive or Google Drive. Additionally, network logs capturing large volume outbound traffic from unusual sources, and access logs from identity and access management solutions can provide insights into potential unauthorized data access activities. |
| Key Indicators | Unusual or suspicious API calls such as ListObjects, GetObject, or 'storage.objects.get' from unexpected IP addresses or locations. Repeated access attempts or failed logins can indicate credential misuse. Large data transfer volumes over short periods, particularly outside normal business hours, may signal data exfiltration attempts. Look for activity associated with known leaked credentials or accounts with excessive permissions. |
| Questions for Analysis | Are there API calls or data access from IP addresses not normally associated with the organization? Do the activities correlate with known legitimate business functions or employees? Is there evidence of access using compromised or overly permissive accounts? Have there been recent changes in access control policies, particularly those that might allow broader or public access? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if there is evidence of data access from unfamiliar geolocations or IP addresses, particularly if sensitive data types might have been accessed. If compromised credentials or suspicious activities tied to high-risk data are detected, this warrants escalation. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify whether the access patterns correspond to known scheduled activities, such as automated backups. Compare suspicious activities against known historical patterns to identify anomalies. Cross-reference identified IP addresses with threat intelligence databases to check for known malicious sources. Confirm account holders of the identified credentials or roles associated with the access. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Perform deeper inspection of the user's activity across other cloud services and audit logs to determine the extent of access. Review IAM configurations and permissions to identify and rectify misconfigurations. Use threat intelligence feeds to validate the legitimacy of source IPs involved in the access. Investigate compromised accounts by analyzing login patterns and behavioral anomalies. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Implement immediate access restrictions or adjustments to IAM policies for compromised or suspicious accounts. Remove public or overly broad access permissions promptly. Engage with affected service providers to ensure log retention and review configurations for security best practices adherence. Perform thorough data classification audits to identify exposed sensitive data. Conduct user education to reinforce best practices related to data access and cloud configurations. |
