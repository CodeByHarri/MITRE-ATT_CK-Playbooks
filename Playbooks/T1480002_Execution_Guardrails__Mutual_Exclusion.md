| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate system logs and application logs for indications of mutex creation and access. For Windows environments, review Windows Event Logs—particularly events related to common APIs that create or acquire mutexes, such as 'NtCreateMutant' or 'CreateMutex'. On Linux systems, review logs that may show file access patterns reflective of mutex file locking, such as 'auditd' logs or logs from tools like 'inotify' which can track file access attempts. |
| Key Indicators | Indicators include the creation or query of specific mutex names that are known to be associated with malicious activity. Repeated failed attempts to acquire mutexes or file locks in a short period can also be indicative. In system logs, look for unusual or suspicious mutex names, especially those that are hard-coded or conform to a pattern used by known malware. |
| Questions for Analysis | Is the mutex name classified as suspicious or known to be associated with malware? Were there any other indicators of compromise observed on the system (e.g., unusual file modifications or network traffic)? How often is the mutex being checked, and is there legitimate software that might be using the mutex under scrutiny? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalation to Tier 2 is warranted if the mutex name or the behavior associated with its usage is matched to a known threat actor or malware family. If multiple instances of similar suspicious activity are detected across multiple systems, this should also prompt escalation. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify the pattern of mutex creation and access—note any correlations with known timelines of malware execution or persistence. Corroborate with other log entries for suspicious file activity or network connections to external IP addresses. Check whether the mutex is part of normal software functionality by researching the name and comparing it with organizational software baselines. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct deeper analysis to trace back the execution flow leading to the mutex creation or attempt to acquire. Utilize threat intelligence to compare mutex names with known datasets. If applicable, perform memory analysis on the affected system to identify further indicators of compromise. Consult historical data to determine if this is part of a wider attack campaign. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | If malicious activity is confirmed, quarantine the affected system to prevent further spread. Remove or disable the malicious service or process associated with the mutex. Utilize endpoint detection and response tools to isolate the process. Conduct a full malware analysis on samples retrieved to understand the persistence mechanisms and further capabilities of the threat. Update incident response protocols and threat signatures to cover new findings. |
