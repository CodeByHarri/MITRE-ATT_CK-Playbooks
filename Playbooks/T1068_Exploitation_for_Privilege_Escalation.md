| Name | Exploitation for Privilege Escalation |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate logs that could indicate exploitation attempts for privilege escalation. Key log sources include: 1. Operating System Logs: Look for unusual or unexpected events in Security logs, especially privilege escalation activities or changes to privilege settings.<br>2. Application Logs: Focus on logs from applications known for vulnerabilities or those running with high privileges.<br>3. Network Logs: Monitor for anomalous downloads or transfers indicative of a vulnerable driver being brought onto a system via [Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105) or [Lateral Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1570). 4. Antivirus and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) logs: Look for alerts marking potentially malicious actions or files like Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) activities. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Discovery of a known vulnerable driver signed by legitimate vendors appearing in unexpected locations or executed in unusual contexts.<br>2. Unscheduled installation of drivers that are known to be vulnerable.<br>3. Evidence of system calls or functions being executed from drivers that typically should not have those capabilities, indicative of exploitation attempts. 4. Network activity patterns consistent with tool transfer as cited directly with downloaded unverified binaries coinciding with privilege escalation events. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Are there recent logins using accounts that typically do not log into the affected system?<br>2. Is there evidence of network communications that suggest the transfer of a driver or exploit tools?<br>3. Have there been recent driver installations or changes that were not sanctioned by IT operations? 4. Do the indicators align with known patterns of privilege escalation through vulnerability exploitation, such as BYOVD attacks? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalation to Tier 2 is required if: 1. A vulnerable driver is discovered running and your investigation reveals it is being used inconsistently with the known legitimate processes.<br>2. Privilege escalation events that cannot be immediately correlated with expected legitimate administrative tasks.<br>3. Any credible evidence of exploitation tools present on the system or network specifically oriented towards privilege escalation. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Verify the legitimacy of any new drivers installed on the system by cross-referencing with an approved software/hardware inventory list.<br>2. Check installation logs and audit trails for unusual activity leading up to the suspicious events.<br>3. Review identity and access management logs to determine if there were unauthorized or abnormal access requests preceding the incident. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Conduct deeper investigation of driver anomalies by searching for further indicators of compromise.<br>2. Perform threat intelligence lookups to assess any emerging threats related to the specific driver or method used.<br>3. Collaborate with vulnerability management teams to assess and confirm whether any security updates could mitigate the identified vulnerability. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Isolate affected machines to prevent further unauthorized elevation of privileges or lateral movement.<br>2. Quarantine and analyze suspicious drivers for malicious behavior and any injected code.<br>3. Conduct a system-wide forensic analysis to identify potential further compromise stemming from the observed privilege escalation, looking for backdoor establishment or credential dumping activities. |
