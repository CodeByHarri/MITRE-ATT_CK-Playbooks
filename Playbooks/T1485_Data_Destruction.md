| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate file system logs to monitor sudden deletion or modification of critical files. Look into security information and event management (SIEM) systems for alerts related to mass file deletions. Check endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools for activities related to typical file deletion commands (e.g., 'del', 'rm') especially if they occur in bulk or repeatedly over a short period. Review access logs for cloud services to identify unauthorized or suspicious deletions of cloud storage objects or database instances. Network traffic logs should also be reviewed for unexpected spikes in activity that might indicate worm-like behavior. |
| Key Indicators | Rapid sequence or bulk file deletions within a short timeframe. Execution of file deletion commands like 'del' or 'rm' across multiple directories. Overwrites of files with seemingly random data or politically oriented images. Unauthorized access or credential-based access from unfamiliar locations prior to file deletion events. Unusual network traffic patterns or SMB-based file share access that could signify propagation attempts. Alerts from cloud provider monitoring services related to deletion of critical assets. |
| Questions for Analysis | Were the deleted files critical to business operations? Is there an indication of persistence mechanisms being established prior to the file deletions? Are there any associated anomalies in network traffic, such as unexpected SMB connections? Do the access logs show any unauthorized attempts to connect to cloud resources? Have similar large-scale deletions been observed across other systems or devices within the network around the same time? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if there is evidence of worm-like propagation behavior, repeated unauthorized access attempts, or if critical infrastructure (both on-premises and cloud) is impacted. Immediate escalation is warranted if there are indications of coordinated attacks across multiple systems or associated alerts about credential dumping and lateral movement. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify the legitimacy of deletion commands by correlating them with user activity and scheduled tasks. Confirm the timeline of deletions to detect any concurrent potentially malicious activities. Check for any alert correlation in SIEM regarding credential access or anomaly in user behavior around the time of deletions. Review recent changes in user permissions that might have allowed the deletions. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct deeper forensic analysis on affected systems to verify if data is overwritten beyond recovery. Utilize EDR solutions to track the file deletion patterns back to their point of origin and check for other affected hosts. Reexamine all access points, including cloud infrastructure, for signs of compromise or misuse. Collaborate with threat intelligence teams to compare indicators with known attack patterns or malware signatures. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Isolate the affected systems from the network to prevent further spread. Work with IT to restore affected files or systems from backups, ensuring the restore process is from secure, uncompromised backups. Strengthen access controls and audit logs on cloud infrastructure to prevent unauthorized deletions. Generate an incident report with detailed findings, and document all actions taken for future review and improvement of defense mechanisms. |
