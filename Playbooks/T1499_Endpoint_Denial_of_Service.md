| Name | Endpoint Denial of Service |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate logs from the following sources: firewall and network traffic logs for unusual traffic patterns indicating an increase in requests from specific IPs or geolocations, web server logs for spikes in request rates or repeated accesses, DNS server logs for unusual query patterns, system performance logs to identify resource exhaustion, intrusion detection system (IDS) alerts for signs of botnet activity or IP spoofing, and application logs for errors or crashes. Examples include web server access logs, NetFlow data, and IDS alerts concerning suspicious or anomalous traffic. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Spike in incoming traffic from diverse IPs suggesting a potential DDoS attack.<br>2. Rapid increase in error response codes (e.g., 500 series errors) in web server logs indicating stress.<br>3. Repeated requests for the same resource, especially with suspicious user-agents or headers. 4. Performance degradation logs showing CPU, memory, or disk I/O exhaustion. 5. Unsuccessful connection attempts or unusual patterns in DNS queries. 6. Any deviations from normal traffic baselines in network monitoring tools. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Have we identified any anomalous patterns in current traffic compared to baseline traffic levels?<br>2. Are there identified IP addresses or user-agents that are generating disproportionately high levels of requests to endpoints?<br>3. Is there any evidence of IP address spoofing detected in the logs? 4. Are there any specific geographical patterns to the incoming traffic? 5. Is the network experiencing any performance degradation or outages that align with the suspicious traffic patterns? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if: 1. Traffic patterns suggest a coordinated attack that cannot be mitigated by current filtering/rate limiting measures.<br>2. Identified IP addresses link to known malicious botnets or repeat offenders.<br>3. There is evidence that the DDoS attack is part of a broader attack including other techniques. 4. The attack has led to significant service disruption or degradation. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Verify the extent of the traffic surge in network traffic monitoring tools.<br>2. Identify and categorize the unique IPs and user-agents contributing to the suspected attack traffic.<br>3. Implement rate limiting or IP blocking for highly suspicious traffic sources. 4. Check for historical data on the identified IPs for any previous suspicious activity. 5. Notify relevant stakeholders about the potential service impacts observed. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Conduct deeper forensic analysis on captured traffic to ascertain the type of DoS attack and possible mitigation strategies.<br>2. Investigate wider threat intelligence for links to known DDoS campaigns or botnets.<br>3. Analyze logs for patterns of IP spoofing or other evasion techniques used by attackers. 4. Coordinate with IT teams to deploy advanced DDoS protection measures like new firewall rules or WAF adjustments. 5. Provide an impact assessment report alongside recommendations for infrastructure hardening. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Implement IP blocking and geofencing strategies for identified redundant and harmful traffic origins.<br>2. Increase resource allocations for critical systems if possible to mitigate downtime.<br>3. Review system configurations and apply patches if any vulnerabilities were suspected to be leveraged in the DDoS method. 4. Engage with external DDoS mitigation services if internal measures are insufficient. 5. Continuous monitoring post-attack phase to ensure no residual impact and identify any reconnection or secondary attack attempts. |
