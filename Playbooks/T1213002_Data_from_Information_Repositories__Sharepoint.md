| Name | Data from Information Repositories: Sharepoint |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Monitor SharePoint access logs to identify unusual access patterns or downloading behavior, especially from external IP addresses or accounts with minimal access history. Inspect proxy logs for data exfiltration through SharePoint-related URLs and anomalous data transfer volumes. Review user activity logs, focusing on user accounts accessing sensitive document libraries or directories. Audit SharePoint configuration change logs to detect unauthorized modifications that may facilitate data access. |
| Key Indicators | Unusual access times or repetitive access to SharePoint sites by users who typically do not interact with the platform. High volume of data downloads from SharePoint, especially of sensitive documents like network diagrams or credential files. Increase in permission assignments or SharePoint site creations. Access requests originating from geographic locations atypical for the user base or atypical file sharing patterns indicating data exfiltration attempts. |
| Questions for Analysis | Is the access or activity being conducted by a user account that typically does not access SharePoint? Are there indications of data exfiltration efforts, such as large numbers of downloads from a single user in a short timeframe? Can the activities be correlated with any known schedule for legitimate administrative tasks or maintenance? Are there any connections to suspicious external IPs related to these activities? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if unusual activity detected involves sensitive document access, especially if it includes security policies, network diagrams, or credentials. Also escalate if there is evidence of large data transfers or if access patterns are consistent with known data exfiltration signatures. Further, escalate if initial user validation fails or if the activity cannot be correlated with legitimate business processes. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Perform user validation to ensure the activity correlates with known user behavior and corporate role. Review login histories to confirm any geographic or temporal anomalies. Check for recent account activity changes, such as password resets or permission changes, possibly indicating account compromise. Validate whether there are business justifications recorded for the access to sensitive locations. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct deeper forensic analysis of network logs and endpoint activity for compromised accounts. Review and correlate the suspicious SharePoint activity with broader internal IT logs to identify any lateral movement or escalated privileges usage. Engage with data owners to verify legitimacy of access to the flagged documents. Collaborate with HR or management to verify the necessity of the activity from the business perspective. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | If a compromise is suspected, disable the suspicious account and reset credentials. Isolate affected systems or restrict access to specific SharePoint sites temporarily. Conduct a comprehensive review of affected data for any unauthorized data exports. Reassess SharePoint access controls and permissions for all users to ensure principle of least privilege is enforced. Prepare a detailed incident report for awareness and assist in improving detection mechanisms for similar activities. |
