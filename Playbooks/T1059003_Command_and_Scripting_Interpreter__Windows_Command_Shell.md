| Name | Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate Windows Event Logs (especially Security and System logs), PowerShell logs, Process Creation logs, and Command Line logging. Specific event IDs to monitor include Event ID 4688 (Windows Security: a new process has been created) and Event ID 7045 (Service Control Manager: a new service was installed). Additionally, review application and system logs for any unexpected execution patterns or tactical use of cmd.exe, such as command prompt invocations at unusual hours or sudden spikes in cmd.exe usage. |
| Key Indicators | Look for execution of cmd.exe with unusual or suspicious command-line arguments, especially those that seem automated or repetitive without an apparent pattern or purpose. Detect anomalies like unauthorized remote invocations, interfacing with system resources without administrative credentials, or sequential batch file executions that mimic known attack patterns (e.g., creating users, altering settings). |
| Questions for Analysis | Is the command shell activity aligned with the user's typical behavior? Are the executed commands typical of the scripts usually run on this system? Was there an unexpected execution of known scripts? Was the command prompt executed from an unexpected source or in an unexpected context (e.g., outside of working hours or from unusual remote IP addresses)? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if there is evidence of successful execution of unexpected or anomalous batch scripts, indications of credential theft or privilege escalation, repetitive execution of commands not typically associated with normal operations, or if the cmd.exe execution is associated with known malicious IP addresses or domains. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Review related historical logs to identify correlating cmd.exe activities. Check for recent changes in user privileges that might explain new cmd.exe usage patterns. Verify if identified cmd.exe processes correlate with authorized administrative tasks. Conduct threat intelligence checks against command shell usage to assess if it matches known attack signatures. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct deeper dive analysis into process trees related to cmd.exe for signs of malicious behavior or unexpected parent-child relationships. Validate the authenticity of remote services and workstations interfacing with the command shell. Use threat hunting tools to look for indicators of compromise aligning with cmd.exe abuse across multiple endpoints. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Isolate affected systems to prevent potential lateral movement. Conduct memory forensics focusing on cmd.exe processes for potential malware traces. Assess network traffic for data exfiltration attempts via the command prompt. Implement system hardening measures, such as user education and enhanced logging, to reduce future abuse of command shells. |
