| Name | Rootkit |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Focus on kernel and system logs, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) alerts, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) data, and file integrity monitoring (FIM) logs. Examine logs from Windows Event Viewer, particularly those related to driver loading and unusual system behaviors. For Linux and Mac systems, review syslog and dmesg for anomalies. Memory dump analysis logs can also be valuable. Utilize tools like Volatility or Rekall for memory analysis logs. Network logs should be analyzed for unusual connections or encrypted traffic associated with known rootkit behavior. |
| Key Indicators | Unexplained hidden files, services, or network connections. Unexpected API call modifications or hooks detected. Presence of unknown drivers or suspicious kernel modules. Discrepancies between low-level system calls and user-level views, indicating tampering. Memory anomalies, such as unusual executable code loaded in kernel space. System instability or frequent crashes without apparent cause. Detection alerts from endpoint security or antivirus solutions flagging known rootkit signatures. |
| Questions for Analysis | Are there discrepancies between system-level and user-level file views? Are there any hidden processes or services running? Do network logs indicate unusual outbound traffic or external communications? Have there been recent, unexplained changes to critical system files or drivers? Are security solutions flagging any rootkit signatures or suspicious behaviors? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if any hidden processes, unexplained kernel modules, or API modifications are confirmed. Also, escalate if memory analysis verifies rootkit-like behaviors or if thereâ€™s evidence of system tampering that can compromise system integrity or security posture. Unusual network behavior that lacks a clear legitimate purpose should be a trigger for escalation. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify log integrity and timestamp consistency. Check for recent patches or system updates that could account for changes. Use system tools like Sysinternals Suite (for Windows) to audit processes, modules, and network connections. Compare system states against baseline configurations. Scan for rootkits using dedicated anti-rootkit tools for initial detection. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Perform in-depth kernel and memory analysis to confirm rootkit presence using tools like Volatility. Correlate log findings with known Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) from threat intelligence repositories. If possible, obtain a forensic image for detailed offline examination. Investigate persistence mechanisms used by the rootkit and assess the potential impact on the infrastructure. Analyze network behavior for further command and control (C2) evidence. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Isolate affected systems to prevent rootkit propagation and data exfiltration. Use safe boot or recovery environments to perform clean-up operations, as some rootkits can evade traditional boot sequences. Remove suspicious drivers and kernel modules and restore affected files from secure backups. Consider system re-imaging if rootkit removal risks system stability. Implement additional monitoring to detect and prevent further infiltration efforts and perform a full post-mortem analysis to strengthen defenses. |
