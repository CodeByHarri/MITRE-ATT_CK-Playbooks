| Log Sources to Investigate | 1. Email logs - Examine headers and metadata for anomalies such as mismatched 'From' addresses, discrepancies in SPF/DKIM/DMARC results, and unusual sending domains.<br>2. Web proxy logs - Monitor access to known malicious or spoofed websites pretending to be legitimate services.<br>3. DNS logs - Search for requests to domains that resemble official company domains but with slight variations. 4. User authentication logs - Review login attempts to detect abnormal patterns, such as logins from unexpected locations or devices. 5. Financial transaction logs - Inspect for unauthorized or unusual transactions initiated after email communications. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Unusual email behavior: instances of typosquatting domains, unusual sending patterns, or inconsistent SPF/DKIM/DMARC checks.<br>2. Use of urgent language and requests in email subject lines or bodies.<br>3. Authentication anomalies, including logins that deviate from typical user behavior, such as geolocation or IP address changes. 4. Newly registered domains that closely mimic existing corporate or partner domains found in DNS queries. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Does the email domain match known and trusted domains for the sender?<br>2. Is there a sudden change in email communication patterns, specifically targeting finance or sensitive data handlers?<br>3. Are there any anomalies in the user's login behavior, such as irregular IP addresses or geolocation? 4. Are the email requests consistent with previous communications, in terms of tone, language, and format? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if any of the following criteria are met: 1. Detection of multiple matching indicators that suggest social engineering or impersonation.<br>2. Evidence of financial transactions or information sharing initiated as a result of the suspicious emails.<br>3. If similar anomalies are detected in other users' accounts or across the organization. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Verify the legitimacy of the sender by cross-referencing official contact records.<br>2. Flag any emails containing urgent language for further review.<br>3. Check user activity logs for any recent changes in access patterns or credentials update requests. 4. Investigate any newly discovered domains that mimic established domains in email logs. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Conduct a deeper investigation into the potentially malicious email and domain: verify domain registration details and history.<br>2. Collaborate with IT and finance departments to ensure any unusual transactions are halted and investigated.<br>3. Perform a detailed review of email headers and metadata for any phishing signs. 4. Identify and assess any compromised accounts related to the suspicious activities. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Isolate affected accounts and reset credentials.<br>2. Block suspicious domains and IP addresses identified during the investigation.<br>3. Review and update email security policies, including SPF, DKIM, and DMARC configurations, to prevent future impersonation attempts. 4. Conduct a post-incident review to identify gaps in detection and improve threat response protocols. 5. Communicate with affected users to inform them of the incident and provide guidelines on identifying such fraud attempts in the future. |
