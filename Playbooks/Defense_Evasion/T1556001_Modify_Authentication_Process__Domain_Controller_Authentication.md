| Name | Modify Authentication Process: Domain Controller Authentication |
| Log Sources to Investigate | 1. Windows Security Logs: Check for unexplained successful or failed logon attempts on domain controllers, particularly on LSASS process activity.<br>2. Domain Controller Event Logs: Look for suspicious modifications or access patterns in the authentication process logs.<br>3. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Logs: Track process injections, modifications, or DLL injections into the LSASS process on domain controllers. 4. Network Traffic Logs: Analyze outbound traffic from domain controllers that might follow an unusual pattern or unexpected destinations. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Unusual authentication success from previously unauthorized accounts without password changes.<br>2. Anomalous process injections or modifications to LSASS on domain controllers.<br>3. High number of authentication attempts succeeding with the same credentials across multiple user accounts. 4. Presence of known malware signatures associated with Skeleton Key or similar threats in security tools. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Are there repeated successful logins for critical accounts from atypical workstations or times?<br>2. Is there any evidence of LSASS process manipulation or unusual memory patterns on domain controllers?<br>3. Have there been any prior alerts or detections related to credential dumping or manipulation on affected systems? 4. Are the successful authentications aligned with known user behavior or flagged as suspicious by UEBA? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if unusual LSASS modifications are detected, especially if corroborated by anomalous authentication logs or if there is a confirmed presence of the Skeleton Key malware signature. Escalate if there is evidence of system backdoors or if a widespread compromise of user accounts is suspected. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Correlate successful authentication logs with known user habits and locations.<br>2. Check for recent patches or changes made to the domain controller that might have coincided with the alerts.<br>3. Verify if any security tools have detected anomalies or potential malware activity on these systems recently. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Conduct memory analysis on affected domain controllers to identify any unauthorized patches or injected code.<br>2. Use forensic tools to analyze LSASS processes and correlating potential time frame of compromise.<br>3. Validate the source and nature of injected credentials and trace them back to any user or malicious processes that might have initiated them. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Isolate the affected domain controllers from the network to prevent further unauthorized access.<br>2. Eradicate any detected malware or injected processes, reboot the domain controllers to clear unauthorized patches.<br>3. Increase logging and monitoring for similar TTPs across the network to prevent further incidents. 4. Conduct a comprehensive audit of affected accounts and enforce credential resets and strengthening of authentication requirements, such as implementing multi-factor authentication. |
