| Name | Modify Cloud Compute Infrastructure: Delete Cloud Instance |
| Log Sources to Investigate | 1. Cloud Provider Logs: Monitor cloud service provider logs such as AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Log, or Google Cloud Audit Logs for delete instance operations. Look specifically for APIs related to instance termination.<br>2. Virtual Machine Logs: Review logs from the virtual machines if they are accessible before deletion.<br>3. Network Traffic Logs: Inspect network traffic for unusual patterns before the instance deletion. 4. IAM Audit Logs: Assess any changes in permissions or roles shortly before instance deletions to identify potential abuse. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Sudden deletion of cloud instances without a corresponding change management record.<br>2. Spike in API calls related to instance termination actions.<br>3. Unusual IAM activity involving permission changes followed by an instance deletion. 4. Creation and immediate deletion of instances which might suggest an adversary is working to minimize their footprint. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Was there any authorized request or incident ticket associated with the instance deletion?<br>2. Were there any suspicious activities or alerts related to this instance before its deletion?<br>3. Are there any patterns in deleted instance operations such as specific times or repeated target instances? 4. Was the user account performing the deletion action involved in recent suspicious activities? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if: 1. There is no legitimate change request or business justification for the instance deletion.<br>2. Previous suspicious activities correlate with the instance or account in question.<br>3. There is potential data exfiltration or manipulation evidence. 4. Patterns suggest repeated anomalous behavior linked to the same source or account. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Verify if the deletion was scheduled or part of a routine operation.<br>2. Check for user account anomalies such as new IP addresses, access pattern changes, or privilege adjustments.<br>3. Confirm with relevant teams (e.g., IT or DevOps) whether this was an expected action. 4. Document and store any related logs or metadata. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Perform a deeper investigation into historical activity from the user account or IAM roles that deleted the instance.<br>2. Cross-reference deletion actions with any open incidents or alerts.<br>3. Utilize cloud provider retention or recovery tools to attempt forensic recovery of deleted instances where possible. 4. Collaborate with cloud security teams to assess the broader impact. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Review and tighten IAM permissions to ensure least privilege.<br>2. Implement alerts for future deletion events that lack a change request.<br>3. Schedule regular audits of instance deletions and creations. 4. Consider enabling backups or snapshots for critical instances to aid in recovery and forensic analysis. |
