| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate Windows Security Logs and Sysmon Logs for process creation events (Event ID 4688 in Security Logs and Event ID 1 in Sysmon Logs) related to mmc.exe execution. Additionally, look for command-line arguments indicating the use of .msc files. Check for Windows Application logs under Event Viewer specifically for 'Microsoft-Windows-GroupPolicy' to identify any unusual or unauthorized usage of group policy editor and other management tools. Monitor Windows Registry changes logs for suspicious modifications, particularly related to CLSID entries. |
| Key Indicators | Key indicators include the execution of mmc.exe with unfamiliar or unauthorized .msc files, especially those not typically used in a standard environment. Unusual command-line arguments invoking mmc.exe, such as 'mmc wbadmin.msc delete catalog -quiet', which indicates potential attempts to inhibit system recovery. Detection of new or modified CLSID values linked to custom .msc files. High frequency of MMC usage disproportionate to normal administrative activities. |
| Questions for Analysis | Is there any scheduled task or process that regularly uses mmc.exe with .msc files in this manner? Are the .msc files being executed known and part of standard administrative tools? Are there notable changes or patterns in CLSID registry keys that correspond with the use of these .msc files? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if there is execution of mmc.exe with unknown or suspicious .msc files, especially if matched with recent modifications to the registry which link to potentially malicious CLSID values. Escalation is warranted if these events are accompanied by attempts to delete backup catalogs or other critical system files. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Confirm the presence of mmc.exe execution in logs and determine the specific .msc file being opened. Correlate these findings with any recent changes in user accounts or privileges. Verify the origin of .msc files and investigate if they are recently created or modified. Check for any abnormal user activity around the time of mmc.exe execution. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Deep dive into the associated .msc file to understand its contents and purpose. Investigate the CLSID entries in the registry for malicious artifacts. Analyze the command line arguments used with mmc.exe for signs of exploitation. Cross-reference this with any external threat intelligence or known indicators of compromise. Engage with the system owner to validate the legitimacy of the actions taken. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Immediately isolate the affected system from the network to prevent potential lateral movement. Block execution of the identified malicious .msc files within the security stack. Restore or verify the integrity of backups if system recovery tools are impacted. Conduct a full forensic investigation for further evidence and root cause analysis. Review and reinforce security policies and monitoring for system binary execution to prevent future misuse. |
