| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate Windows event logs for process creation events (Event ID 4688) to monitor for the execution of mavinject.exe, particularly with suspicious command line parameters such as /INJECTRUNNING or /HMODULE. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions can also be leveraged to correlate these events with potentially malicious activity. Additionally, endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions should be configured to capture and analyze process injection activities and command line arguments. Examples: Sysmon logs for Event ID 1 (Process Creation), PowerShell logs for script executions initiating mavinject.exe, and Windows Defender logs for any detections involving mavinject.exe. |
| Key Indicators | - Execution of mavinject.exe with command line arguments /INJECTRUNNING or /HMODULE<br>- Unsigned DLLs being injected into legitimate processes<br>- Sudden or unexpected spawning of mavinject.exe from non-standard processes or scripts<br>- Presence of DLL files in unusual directories that mavinject.exe attempts to inject |
| Questions for Analysis | - Is mavinject.exe executed with known benign command line arguments, or does it have suspicious parameters?<br>- Are there legitimate processes associated with the suspected execution (e.g., known application updates or virtualization tasks)?<br>- Are there any other indicators of malicious activity around the same timeframe (e.g., anomalous network connections, file modifications)?<br>- Have any alerts or detections from antivirus or EDR solutions been triggered in relation to these activities? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if mavinject.exe is executed with suspicious parameters and there are additional corroborative indicators of compromise, such as unsigned DLLs, anomalous network activity, or if mavinject.exe is spawned by non-standard or suspicious parent processes. Also, escalate if there is confirmation of specific adversarial threat activity targeting the organization or if impact on critical systems is detected or suspected. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | - Verify the legitimacy of mavinject.exe execution using command line arguments and parent process relationships from logs.<br>- Check the origin of the DLL files involved in injection attempts and validate their signatures.<br>- Review user account activity associated with suspicious mavinject.exe executions for abnormal use patterns.<br>- Cross-reference with recent alerts from IPS/IDS or heuristics-based threat detection systems. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | - Deep-dive analysis on the process tree and memory analysis of potentially affected systems to identify injected DLLs or malcode.<br>- Conduct forensic analysis on DLLs and investigate their purpose and potential compromise vector.<br>- Review historical execution patterns for mavinject.exe within the environment to establish baseline and identify anomalies.<br>- Engage with threat intelligence resources to correlate with known threat actor TTPs and assess the risk of targeted campaigns. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | - Isolate affected systems to prevent further spread of malicious activity.<br>- Investigate and remove any malicious DLLs or scripts involved in the intrusion to neutralize the threat.<br>- Conduct a full anti-virus/malware scan and memory analysis across potentially affected endpoints.<br>- Implement EDR/YARA rules to monitor and block future suspicious executions of mavinject.exe with malicious parameters.<br>- Perform a detailed review of network traffic logs for any data exfiltration attempts or unusual outbound connections. |
