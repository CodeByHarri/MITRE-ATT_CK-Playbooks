| Name | Obfuscated Files or Information: Embedded Payloads |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate logs from application monitoring systems (such as Sysmon), file integrity monitoring logs, and antimalware/antivirus logs. Look specifically for unusual changes in file hashes, file creation/update timestamps, and any telemetry showing unusual file read/write operations. System event logs and network traffic logs should be reviewed to identify any execution of suspicious files and unexpected outbound connections from otherwise benign applications. Examples include logs capturing PowerShell script activity, execution logs from binary analysis tools, and security appliance logs that detect payload embedding techniques. |
| Key Indicators | Unusual file size increases that are inconsistent with normal file behavior, changes in file metadata without changes in associated business processes, detection of forbidden file types or unusual file formats being downloaded or executed, and files with missing or suspicious digital signatures. Monitoring for execution of embedded payloads via process injection techniques such as anomalous cross-process injection into legitimate system processes. Network connections from unexpected applications communicating over non-standard ports can also serve as an indicator. |
| Questions for Analysis | Are there any recently modified files of larger than expected sizes with no record of expected operational changes? Have any benign processes exhibited anomalous behavior like unexpected network communication or high CPU/memory usage? Is there evidence of script execution from a normally static file set, particularly from file types known to have embedded content capabilities (e.g., scripts, macros)? Are there detection alerts from endpoint protection systems that correlate with these findings? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if there are confirmed indicators of unexpected file modifications suggesting possible payload embedding, unexplained execution of known or unknown scripts/binaries from unusual locations, telemetry indicating process injection activities into critical system processes, or alert correlation indicating potential execution of embedded malicious content. Escalation is also warranted if embedding techniques are suspected to have bypassed defensive mechanisms, suggesting a layered intrusion attempt. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Confirm source of suspicious file modifications through change management documentation if available. Use static and dynamic analysis tools to examine suspicious files for embedded content. Confirm digital signatures on files and verify against expected certificates. Conduct basic checks on script execution history and process activity for known malicious patterns. Correlate security alerts with related telemetry for supporting context. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Perform advanced file analysis, including unpacking and reverse engineering, to identify and assess potential embedded payloads. Utilize behavioral analysis and sandboxing to observe potential malicious execution. Investigate the scope of any detected process injection, focusing on identifying the origin process and evaluating its role within the broader attack chain. Validate and enrich detections through threat intelligence sources. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further propagation. Remove or quarantine suspicious files and halt any executing malicious processes using endpoint response tools. Perform in-depth forensic analysis on isolated systems to assess the extent of compromise and gather further evidence. Engage in threat hunting across the environment to identify additional instances or variations of the threat. Prepare incident reports and liaise with relevant stakeholders for a coordinated response effort. |
