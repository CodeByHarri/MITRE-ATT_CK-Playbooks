| Name | Hide Artifacts: File/Path Exclusions |
| Log Sources to Investigate | 1. File Access Logs: Monitor access and write operations to folders or files known for AV exclusions. Examples include C:\Windows\Temp, C:\ProgramData, or other application-specific exclusion paths.<br>2. Security Software Logs: Examine AV logs for any events that might indicate skipped scans or alerts related to file exclusions.<br>3. System Event Logs: Look for unusual file creation or modification events, particularly in paths known for exclusions. 4. Process Monitoring Logs: Review processes that initiate file writes to these excluded paths, especially those initiated by non-standard applications or scripts. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Creation of files or directories within known exclusion paths that do not match legitimate application profiles.<br>2. Process execution leading to file writes in exclusion folders without corresponding legitimate application activity.<br>3. Unusual patterns of access to exclusion paths, especially from processes that typically do not interact with these directories. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Is the file being accessed or created in an exclusion path associated with known legitimate software?<br>2. Is there a legitimate business justification for modifying or creating files in these paths?<br>3. Are there any alerts from AV or security software indicating skipped scans due to exclusions? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if: 1. There is no clear business justification or legitimate application associated with the file creation/modification in exclusion paths.<br>2. There is evidence of unusual or unauthorized processes accessing or creating files in exclusion folders.<br>3. File or process activity is accompanied by other suspicious indicators, such as network connections to known bad IPs. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Correlate file or process activities in exclusion paths with legitimate software documentation and usage schedules.<br>2. Verify recent modifications or installations of software that might justify AV exclusions.<br>3. Cross-check affected systems for recent AV alerts or updates. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Perform a deep-dive analysis of file contents and metadata, especially any newly created or modified files in exclusion paths.<br>2. Investigate any associated network traffic or communications initiated by processes writing to these paths.<br>3. Retrieve and analyze any relevant registry changes that could relate to security settings adjustments. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Initiate containment by isolating affected systems to prevent further compromise.<br>2. Work with IT to whitelist legitimate files and ensure AV configurations are properly documented and enforced.<br>3. Conduct a full system scan, if necessary, on isolated hosts to identify additional threats. 4. Review organizational AV exclusions and policies to ensure they're being properly utilized and not opening unnecessary gaps. |
