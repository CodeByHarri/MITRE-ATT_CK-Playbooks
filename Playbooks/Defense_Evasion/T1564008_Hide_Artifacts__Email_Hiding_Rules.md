| Name | Hide Artifacts: Email Hiding Rules |
| Log Sources to Investigate | 1. Email server logs (e.g., Exchange Server logs) to track rules being created, modified, or deleted.<br>2. PowerShell logs, especially looking for <code>New-InboxRule</code> and <code>Set-InboxRule</code> cmdlets usage.<br>3. SIEM solutions to aggregate and correlate data from different sources for suspicious patterns or anomalies in email-related activities. 4. Cloud application security logs specific to email services (e.g., Microsoft Cloud App Security) for policy violations or anomalous activity. 5. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) logs to see if email clients are being manipulated or if scripts are being run to create rules. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Creation or modification of email rules that move emails with suspicious keywords (such as <code>malware</code>, <code>suspicious</code>, etc.) to obscure folders or automatically delete them.<br>2. Unusual frequency of <code>New-InboxRule</code> and <code>Set-InboxRule</code> cmdlet execution.<br>3. Sudden increase in email rule creation activity, especially in quick succession. 4. Email rules being set up by accounts recently compromised or behaving anomalously. 5. Organization-wide email rule changes, particularly those related to security alerts or specific targeted topics. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Has the user account been flagged or involved in any recent suspicious activity or security incidents?<br>2. Are the email rules targeting specific keywords that align with common security alerts or internal spear-phishing tactics?<br>3. Is there a legitimate need for the email rule based on user roles or organizational policy? 4. Are multiple accounts showing similar newly created or modified email rules, indicating a broader attack scope? 5. Are these changes occurring outside of typical business hours or from unusual IP addresses suggesting unauthorized access? |
| Decision for Escalation | 1. Escalate if email rules are being created or modified in bulk with no legitimate justification.<br>2. Escalate if email rules target specific security keywords and the same pattern is observed across multiple users.<br>3. Escalate if email rule changes are being made by accounts that also exhibit signs of compromise or are involved in other SOC alerts. 4. Escalate if there are organization-wide email rule modifications without administrative oversight or justification. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Validate the legitimacy of email rule changes by consulting with end-users to understand the necessity of such rules.<br>2. Review recent login activity for the user accounts involved in creating or modifying email rules for unusual geographic locations or times.<br>3. Cross-reference activities with recent phishing or credential compromise incidents within the organization. 4. Check if newly created or modified rules align or conflict with any existing security policies. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Conduct a deeper investigation into any identified anomalies in user behavior around the time of email rule changes.<br>2. Review organization-wide email security policies and configurations to identify potential vulnerabilities being exploited.<br>3. Perform a comprehensive audit of access logs to identify other potentially compromised accounts. 4. Engage with affected users and gather more context or signs of additional malicious activity like unauthorized external communications. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Immediately disable suspicious email rules and notify affected users.<br>2. Advise password changes and potentially initiate password resets for impacted accounts.<br>3. Implement or review Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across the organization if not already in place. 4. Conduct an organization-wide email rule integrity check to ensure no further malicious rules are present. 5. Analyze impacted emails that were moved or deleted to identify potential attacker objectives and targets. 6. Provide a detailed report and briefing on the incident's nature, scope, and recommended preventive measures to leadership and security teams. |
