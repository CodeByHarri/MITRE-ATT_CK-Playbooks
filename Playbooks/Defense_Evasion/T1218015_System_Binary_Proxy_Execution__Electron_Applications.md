| Name | System Binary Proxy Execution: Electron Applications |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Windows Event Logs, specifically Security (Event ID 4688 for process creation), Application logs, and System logs. Investigate logs from Electron-based applications like Slack, Microsoft Teams, and browser logs for applications like Chrome. Additionally, inspect PowerShell and command line logs for unusual command execution patterns that may align with known Electron abuse techniques. |
| Key Indicators | Unusual child processes spawned by known Electron applications (e.g., 'teams.exe', 'chrome.exe'). Presence of command line arguments used to execute external programs, especially those running system utilities or scripts (e.g., '--gpu-launcher="C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c calc.exe"'). Unexpected modifications or additions of JavaScript code in the application directory. Abnormal network communications initiated by Electron applications without user activity. |
| Questions for Analysis | Was there a recent update or legitimate configuration change to the Electron application? Does the process tree show an unusual lineage or unexpected parent-child relationships involving Electron apps? Are there recent spikes in network activity or communications from the application at odd hours or without user interaction? Is there any known vulnerability in the version of Electron or the application that could be exploited? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if the child processes are spawned abruptly by unrecognized or external command-line arguments. Escalate if there is visible evidence of JavaScript code insertion/replacement or if unauthorized network connections are detected. Escalate any evidence of file manipulation inside application directories connected to Electron. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify the legitimacy of the Electron application's version and patch status. Check for known vulnerabilities or recent security advisories. Cross-reference against other security tools for correlated alerts. Capture a snapshot of the process tree for suspicious Electron activities. Create a summary report of all observations and unusual outputs for Tier 2. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Assess the applicationâ€™s file integrity status to pinpoint modifications. Conduct a deeper review of process execution chains and command line arguments for malicious patterns. Utilize forensic tools to inspect network packet captures and identify suspect traffic patterns initiated by the Electron application. Perform a comparative analysis against any similar incidents reported in threat intelligence databases. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Isolate the system if any malicious activity is confirmed to prevent further lateral movement. Apply relevant patches or updates to the Electron application to close any vulnerabilities. Remove or quarantine any detected malicious scripts or binaries. Conduct a broader review of the network to detect similar patterns in other systems. Report findings to IT for remediation of potential vulnerabilities within the Electron framework and apply strengthened monitoring protocols moving forward. |
