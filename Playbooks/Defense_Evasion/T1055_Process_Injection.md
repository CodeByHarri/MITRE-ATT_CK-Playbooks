| Name | Process Injection |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Monitor Process Monitoring logs, Windows Event Logs (especially Sysmon Event ID 7 for Image Load and Event ID 10 for ProcessAccess), Linux auditd logs, and any Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions. Capture and review logs that indicate new processes spawned by critical system binaries or unexpected child processes. Review security tools logs for indicators of suspicious DLL or PE loading into processes. |
| Key Indicators | Unusual parent-child process relationships; abnormal DLL or PE injection detected by EDR; memory space read, write, or executed by unrelated or unexpected processes; sudden spikes in CPU or memory usage by non-core applications; presence of known malicious injectors like reflective DLL injection; anomalous access to sensitive process memory (such as LSASS); usage of CreateRemoteThread(), ZwWriteVirtualMemory(), or related API functions without expected reasons. |
| Questions for Analysis | Is the injected process commonly targeted by malware for injection, such as web browsers or system utilities like explorer.exe? Is there any recent vulnerability or CVE that could facilitate the observed injection technique? Is the behavior consistent with benign activities from known applications or updates? Has the injecting process or the target process executed any known malicious commands post-injection? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate if the injected process involves sensitive or high-privilege processes such as svchost.exe, LSASS, or any AV/EDR solutions. Escalate if there is evidence of post-injection activity that indicates further malicious behavior, such as network connections to known C2 servers or attempts to disable security software. If initial analysis indicates attempts to elevate privileges or presence of known malicious injectors. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify the legitimacy of both the injecting and target processes by checking their signed status and source paths. Cross-reference any child processes spawned from potentially injected processes against threat intelligence feeds for known threats. Utilize EDR tools to check process lineage and track anomalous behavior patterns or network activity. Report findings to T2 upon identifying suspicious behavior. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct deeper forensic analysis using memory dumps and sandbox execution of the suspected malware. Leverage threat intelligence services to correlate IP, domains or hashes observed with known threat groups or campaigns. Monitor network traffic for communications post-injection, especially to external addresses. Audit historical data for repeated patterns or precursor activities associated with injections. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent data exfiltration. Utilize system restore points or backups to revert to a safe state if malicious activity is confirmed. If unknown vulnerabilities are exploited, patch systems accordingly. Create Yara rules or signatures for detection based on forensic findings, and implement IOC blocking in firewalls and EDR solutions. Continually update documentation and provide incident reports to stakeholders. |
