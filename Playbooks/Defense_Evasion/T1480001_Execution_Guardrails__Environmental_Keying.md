| Log Sources to Investigate | Analyze system event logs, especially focusing on unusual or unexpected process execution. Network logs should be checked for encrypted communication that might indicate unusual key exchange attempts (e.g. domain joined information, system time or IP-specific cryptography). Investigate logs from endpoint protection platforms for alerts associated with cryptographic activities or anomalies in process executions. Application logs that detail operating environments, such as Active Directory logs, can help identify activities tied to specific domains or environment conditions. Examples include Windows Event Logs, Sysmon logs for detailed process creation (Event ID 1), and Security logs for special logon events (Event ID 4672). |
| Key Indicators | Suspicious encrypted payload execution attempts, presence of malware artifacts that utilize environment-specific cryptographic keys, non-standard network connections from known systems/devices, process attempted by unknown executable but only succeeding in specific system environments, failed execution attempts of suspicious binaries in sandboxed or non-target environments. |
| Questions for Analysis | Was there a noticeable deviation from normal execution profiles in the environment? Are the encrypted payload attempts linked to known threat actors? Is there evidence of failed decryption attempts or environment checks? Do logs show consistent patterns with target-specific details such as system clock manipulation, AD domains, or particular network shares? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate if a process or payload shows attempts to use environment-specific values for decryption or if there is detectable communication with known malicious infrastructure that aligns with this TTP. Additionally, escalate if there's evidence indicating multiple failed access attempts to target-specific resources that suggest attempts to match environmental keys. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Cross-check flagged events against known IOCs and threat intelligence feeds to identify potential adversarial activity. Investigate user and system behavior around the time of the suspicious activity. Ensure that logs capture sufficient data to confirm that the activity aligns with environmental keying behaviour and not legitimate cryptographic use. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Perform deeper forensic analysis on the affected systems, focusing specifically on disk analysis for remnants of encrypted payloads or dropper files. Conduct network packet analysis for signs of unmonitored or abnormal encrypted exchanges. Correlate findings with external threat data to ascertain whether the activity aligns with known threat actor TTPs. Verify the integrity and authenticity of local cryptographic libraries and APIs. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Quarantine affected systems to prevent the possible spread or activation of malicious payloads. Where feasible, isolate network segments involved in suspicious activity to assess and mitigate any additional exposure. Perform memory analysis on the quarantined systems to identify loaded malicious modules or artifacts. Develop detailed timeline analysis to understand the sequence of events leading to detection and inform further threat hunting exercises. |
