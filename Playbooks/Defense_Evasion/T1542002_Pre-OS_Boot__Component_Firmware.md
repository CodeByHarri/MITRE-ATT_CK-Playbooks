| Name | Pre-OS Boot: Component Firmware |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Collect logs from hardware component diagnostics tools that can detect and report firmware changes. These may include logs from vendor-specific firmware update utilities (e.g., Dell BIOS update logs), system management software logs (e.g., HP System Management), and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions that have firmware integrity monitoring capabilities. Additionally, inspection of Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) logs, if available, can assist in identifying unauthorized modifications. |
| Key Indicators | Unexpected firmware version numbers or firmware on components that differ from the expected norms; anomalies in the boot process or irregular boot performance; lack of logged firmware updates that match noted changes; and alerts from security tools that monitor firmware integrity checks failing or inconsistencies in known image baselines. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Has there been an approved firmware update recently on the affected system?<br>2. Are there inconsistencies between the firmware version reported by the hardware and the expected 'gold standard' versions?<br>3. Is there evidence of altered boot sequences or boot process anomalies? 4. Are there any reports of issues from the same component across multiple systems? 5. Do logged events correlate with known legitimate user or administrative actions? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if: a) Firmware version discrepancies are confirmed without corresponding authorized updates. b) There is evidence of boot process anomalies potentially indicative of unauthorized manipulation. c) Firmware changes are observed on multiple systems or associated with other suspicious activities. d) Potential impact on critical systems or sensitive data is identified. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Cross-reference current firmware version logs against authorized documentation. Verify with asset management systems or IT documentation to ensure only authorized updates have been applied. Review recent network logs to identify any communication with potential adversarial command and control (C2) servers. Examine endpoint security alerts that might indicate related suspicious activity. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct deeper forensic analysis of affected hardware components to ascertain the origin and intent of firmware changes. Gather and analyze system images, configuration files, and correlated logs for comprehensive insights. Validate against threat intelligence for known firmware-level attack patterns. Coordinate with OEMs for verification of firmware integrity and legitimacy of updates. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Immediately isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration. Back up critical data, if possible, prior to full analysis. Engage with hardware vendors for comprehensive firmware integrity checks and updates. Deploy known clean firmware images when possible, and ensure any discovered vulnerabilities are patched. Monitor network and system activity closely post-restoration for any resurgence of anomalies. |
