| Name | Modify Authentication Process |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Collect logs from authentication-related systems and applications. Specifically, examine: <br>- Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) logs on Windows for unexpected modifications or anomalies. <br>- Security Accounts Manager (SAM) logs for unauthorized access attempts. <br>- Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) logs on Unix-based systems for unexpected changes. <br>- MacOS authorization plugin logs for modifications to the authentication process. <br>- Network logs for unusual VPN, Outlook Web Access, or remote desktop access attempts. <br>- Windows Event Logs, particularly Security logs, for any unusual authentication activity or account access. |
| Key Indicators | Look for specific signs of compromise such as: <br>- Unexpected changes in LSASS, SAM, or PAM configurations. <br>- Logs showing new or modified authentication plugins or modules. <br>- Increase in failed authentication attempts followed by a successful one. <br>- Unusual patterns in authentication-related network traffic. <br>- Alerts or warnings from endpoint detection systems about unauthorized changes to authentication processes. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Are there recent changes in authentication mechanisms that were not approved or documented? <br>2. Are there any accounts exhibiting unusual login behaviors, such as logins from atypical locations or at odd times? <br>3. Has there been an unexpected spike in authentication failure events? <br>4. Are there copies of these logs indicating attempts to hide or modify their contents? <br>5. Do system configurations show unauthorized users being granted privileges? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if: <br>- There is evidence of unauthorized modifications to authentication processes. <br>- Tier 1 analysis indicates potential use of compromised credentials. <br>- Anomalies in authentication logs are tied to critical accounts or systems. <br>- Multiple systems across the network show similar suspicious behaviors, indicating coordinated activity. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Confirm any unauthorized changes against system change logs or administrator approvals. <br>2. Verify timestamps and geolocations of suspicious logins against company policy or known user movements. <br>3. Check for associated security alerts or warnings that could provide context. <br>4. Review recent installations or updates to authentication software that might have introduced vulnerabilities. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Conduct deeper investigation into suspicious authentication attempts, tracing IP addresses and devices associated with potential unauthorized access. <br>2. Perform forensic analysis on affected systems to identify modifications or injected malicious code. <br>3. Correlate findings with threat intelligence data to assess potential threats or APT group attributions. <br>4. Work with IT to reverse unauthorized changes and implement protective measures. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Immediately disable or isolate compromised accounts to prevent further unauthorized access. <br>2. Restore authentication configurations to known good states from backups. <br>3. Run comprehensive malware and system integrity scans on potentially affected systems. <br>4. Monitor affected systems closely for signs of persistence mechanisms, implementing enhanced logging and alerts. <br>5. Collaborate with incident response teams to inform stakeholders and plan for potential broader organizational impacts. |
