| Name | Pre-OS Boot: System Firmware |
| Log Sources to Investigate | 1. Firmware Logs: Access logs related to BIOS/UEFI changes or updates.<br>2. System Event Logs: Look for entries related to system boot processes or firmware update activities.<br>3. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) alerts: Monitor for unusual firmware update patterns. 4. Hardware Health Monitoring Tools: Alerts from tools that check for firmware integrity. Examples include Intel AMT logs and Dell OpenManage logs. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Unscheduled Firmware Updates: Any firmware update log entries outside of regular maintenance windows.<br>2. Mismatch Between Current Firmware and Known Baselines: Discrepancies indicating modifications from expected versions.<br>3. Alerts for Unauthorized Firmware Access: SIEM or endpoint protection alarms related to attempts to write to firmware memory. 4. Sudden Reboots or Shutdowns: Unexplained system reboots that may point to covert firmware changes. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Were there any legitimate updates scheduled or performed recently that coincide with the detected firmware changes?<br>2. Has there been any historical precedence of such firmware modifications on the affected systems?<br>3. Are there known vulnerabilities in the specific firmware versions currently running on affected systems? 4. Has user activity been consistent with the changes (e.g., authentic admin actions)? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if: 1. There is no justification for recent firmware changes, and no scheduled maintenance is confirmed.<br>2. There's evidence of mismatch with known good firmware baselines.<br>3. Unauthorized access attempts to the firmware are persistent and cannot be explained by any legitimate action. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Correlate firmware update logs with Windows Event Logs to identify any legitimate administrative actions.<br>2. Check for any associated user log on activities or credential use during the time the firmware changes were detected.<br>3. Verify with IT or systems management teams if any updates were pushed through official channels. 4. Use tools like CHIPSEC to gather the current firmware version for further analysis. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Perform a detailed comparison of the firmware hash against a known-good baseline to detect unauthorized modifications.<br>2. Review network logs for any signs of data exfiltration or C2 communication, correlating with the time of firmware changes.<br>3. Use advanced forensics tools to capture and analyze firmware images offline. 4. Collaborate with hardware vendors to verify firmware integrity and check for any known vulnerabilities or attack vectors. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Isolate affected systems to prevent potential spread or further malicious activity.<br>2. Initiate a known-good firmware restore procedure if unauthorized modifications are confirmed.<br>3. Increase monitoring on the network and deploy specific intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) rules targeting the discovered threat vector. 4. Engage with OEM support for a deep firmware threat analysis and develop custom patches to prevent similar exploits. |
