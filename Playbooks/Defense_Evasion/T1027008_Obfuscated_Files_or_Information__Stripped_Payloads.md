| Name | Obfuscated Files or Information: Stripped Payloads |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Collect logs from code compilation and build systems which might include build server logs, source code management logs, and CI/CD pipeline logs. Monitor file integrity and modification logs for unexpected changes to executable or script files. Investigate endpoint detection and response (EDR) logs for unusual execution patterns of newly compiled binaries or scripts. Consider reviewing application logs for instances of binaries executing without standard human-readable symbols. |
| Key Indicators | Presence of executable files with minimal or no debugging symbols or human-readable strings. Detection of file types like run-only AppleScripts or unusually small ELF binaries with stripped symbols. Sudden appearance of newly compiled binaries/scripts in production environments that lack normal symbol information. |
| Questions for Analysis | Do the stripped payloads align with standard compilation practices in the organization, or do they appear unusual? Are the stripped binaries/scripts making unexpected network connections or accessing unusual resources? Has there been a sudden change in file sizes or compile times indicating recompilation at unexpected times? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if the executable or script was not authorized or expected within the environment, if it is attempting network connections to suspicious or unauthorized IP address ranges, or if it shows unexpected behavior such as persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation attempts. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify the legitimacy of the source of the stripped binaries against known software deployment schedules. Check for any alerts or logs that may highlight unusual behavior of the binaries. Collaborate with development teams to confirm whether any new stripping practices were recently introduced deliberately. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Perform static and dynamic analysis of the stripped payload using sandbox environments. Communicate with application owners or developers to confirm the intention behind the creation of stripped binaries. Inspect network traffic generated by the suspicious binaries/scripts for anomalies. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Isolate the affected systems hosting or executing the suspicious stripped binaries/scripts to prevent potential lateral movement. Retrieve forensic copies of the stripped binaries for further examination. Consider redeploying clean versions of affected applications and review compilation practices to prevent unauthorized deployment of stripped code. |
