| Log Sources to Investigate | Monitor container orchestration logs such as Kubernetes API server logs, which provide insights into container deployments. Look for unusual activities in Docker logs, including the use of the 'create' and 'start' APIs. Check Cloud provider logs (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, GCP audit logs) if applicable, for container management actions. Network traffic logs that may indicate communication patterns associated with newly deployed containers also help, as do system and application logs on nodes where containers are frequently deployed. |
| Key Indicators | Unexpected container deployment activities, such as sudden spikes in container creation from unknown or unauthorized images. Auth logs showing access from unusual IP addresses related to container management APIs. Alterations to container configurations, especially those granting elevated privileges or altering network rules. Network traffic to and from recently deployed containers, especially connections to known suspicious domains. |
| Questions for Analysis | Is the container deployment activity coming from a known and verified account or IP address? Are the deployed containers based on officially sanctioned images, or are they using images from unverified sources? Are there any abnormal patterns such as privileged permissions or lack of resource constraints for the containers? Are there any related alerts or exceptions in allied defense tools, such as EDR? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate if container deployments are detected using images from unverified sources or if there is evidence of deploying a privileged container. Escalation is also warranted if the log review shows the pattern of accesses involving unusual IPs or excessive use of container API commands during non-business hours. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify the owner(s) of the originating IP addresses and the timestamps for the container deployment. Check the source and integrity of images used for new deployments. Correlate with user access logs to determine if there were any unauthorized accesses. Review network logs for any external connections established by the new containers. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct a deeper analysis of the deployed containers' behavior, focussing on process creation and network connections initiated by the container. Perform threat intelligence checks on the images used to see if they are tied to known threats or malicious actors. Evaluate the container configuration for potential security misconfigurations or vulnerabilities. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Isolate affected containers by disabling their network connectivity and access permissions. Capture container filesystems and relevant logs for forensic investigation. Perform a security review of the orchestrator and container configurations. Consider redeploying secure and verified images to tenants if malicious activity is confirmed. Propose patching or updates where configuration vulnerabilities are identified. |
