| Name | Modify Cloud Compute Infrastructure: Modify Cloud Compute Configurations |
| Log Sources to Investigate | The primary log sources to investigate for detecting modifications to cloud compute configurations include: 1. Cloud Management Console Audit Logs: Track any changes made through the cloud provider's management interface. For example, AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Logs, or Google Cloud Audit Logs.<br>2. Quota Change Requests: Logs of any quota change requests submitted by users. This might be part of the service logs or specific system generated logs tracking requests.<br>3. Cloud Policy Change Logs: Look for modifications to tenant-wide policies that control compute resources. Azure Policy logs or AWS Config logs may capture such changes. 4. Cloud Network Logs: Investigate any unexpected deployment activities, especially in unused or unsupported regions which can be captured by VPC Flow Logs or equivalent in other services. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Unexplained increases in quota requests or approvals.<br>2. Modifications to tenant-wide policies affecting resource allocation.<br>3. Deployment of resources in disabled or non-business regions. 4. Sudden spikes in resource usage without corresponding business justification. 5. Changes to service configurations that have not been documented according to standard change management processes. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Were the changes to cloud configurations approved and documented within the change management system?<br>2. Who initiated the changes? Are they authorized personnel or does it align with known malicious indicators (e.g., suspicious IP addresses, times of access, etc.)?<br>3. Is there a business justification for the change in compute configurations or quotas? 4. Do the actions recorded in the logs match typical user behavior patterns, or do they stand out as anomalies? 5. Are there any concurrent anomalous activities (resource hijacking, unexpected network traffic) occurring at the time of configuration changes? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalation to Tier 2 is warranted if: 1. The changes in configuration were not approved or documented per company policy.<br>2. There is evidence suggesting the user account that made the changes has been compromised (e.g., logins from an unusual IP address).<br>3. The altered settings lead to unauthorized activities, such as deployment in unsupported regions without business justification. 4. If there is a pattern of repeated unexpected resource usage increases correlating with configuration changes. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Verify if there are tickets or documentation supporting the changes observed.<br>2. Cross-reference user activity against known normal patterns for the entity making the changes.<br>3. Check recent access history for the accounts involved in the changes to identify anomalies. 4. Perform a basic threat intelligence check for the user's IP and device details for known malicious activity. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Conduct a thorough review of the recent change management requests and approvals.<br>2. Examine historical changes made by the accounts involved to identify a pattern of unusual behavior.<br>3. Utilize threat hunting techniques to explore if the configuration changes align with known TTPs of cloud modification abuse. 4. Consult with the business units or stakeholders to confirm if similar requests were expected or if it aligns with current projects. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Restrict the affected accounts and apply additional authentication measures if necessary (e.g., MFA).<br>2. Reverse unauthorized configuration changes to enforce standard security policies.<br>3. Conduct a full incident post-mortem analysis to understand the breach's entry point. 4. Review and possibly enhance logging, monitoring, and alerting capabilities on quota and configuration change activities to detect future occurrences early. |
