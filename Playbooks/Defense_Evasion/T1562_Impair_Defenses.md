| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate security logs from endpoint protection software for any disabled or altered configurations. Review firewall logs for suspicious configuration changes. Audit system event logs (e.g., Windows Event Logs such as Security and System logs) for service stoppage or alteration of security settings. Check application logs for unusual behaviors or alerts related to anti-virus/malware software being disabled or tampered with. Network logs can also reveal unusual access or blocking changes to defense mechanisms. |
| Key Indicators | Unusual patterns or records of change in settings of security tools or configurations. Discrepancies in the normal update processes or logs indicating failures or stoppages. Alert or warning events indicating unexpected shutdown or disablement of services such as anti-virus or firewall. Correlation of administrative credential use at unusual times or from unusual geographic locations. Modified or missing log files, especially within a timeframe associated with a security event. |
| Questions for Analysis | Were there any recent configuration changes to security systems that were not officially approved or documented? Have there been any recent alerts regarding service disruptions for firewalls, anti-virus, or other defensive mechanisms? Was the update process altered or scheduled updates missed? Are there any patterns of failed logins or atypical user behaviors that correlate with observed security control changes? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate if there are multiple, unexplained changes to critical security controls that coincide with recent security alerts or anomalies. Also, escalate if there is evidence of administrative tools accessed or used outside normal business hours without corresponding logs of legitimate activity. Finally, raise an alert if widely-used defensive mechanisms were disabled or impaired without a valid reason. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify with IT and security teams whether the detected changes were authorized. Check user access logs to identify potential misuse of administrative privileges. Consolidate logs from different sources to check for patterns or simultaneous suspicious activities. Collaborate with security tool vendors to confirm whether detected impairments were part of known issues or updates. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct a deeper review into the timeline and sequence of suspicious activities discovered by L1. Use threat intelligence feeds to match observed behavior with known threat actor techniques. Simulate potential impacts through red teaming or controlled tests if defensive mechanisms had failed. Monitor network traffic for indicators of ongoing or further malicious activity related to impaired defenses. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Immediately apply patches or updates to restore any impaired systems or software configurations. Re-enable and reconfigure tampered security controls using updated baseline configurations. Increase logging and monitoring of affected systems and networks to rapidly detect any recurrence. Conduct a root cause analysis to identify and address the vulnerability or vector exploited. |
