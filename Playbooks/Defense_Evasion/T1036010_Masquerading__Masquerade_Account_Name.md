| Log Sources to Investigate | To investigate potential masquerading of account names, analysts should focus on Active Directory logs, IAM (Identity and Access Management) logs, and system event logs. Specifically, the creation of new accounts and any changes to account names should be examined. Logs from authentication systems like LDAP or cloud identity services (e.g., AWS IAM, Azure AD) are crucial. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions may also capture suspicious account activities. |
| Key Indicators | 1. The creation of accounts with names similar to existing service accounts or typical admin accounts (e.g., 'admln', 'adminstrator', etc.).<br>2. Account name changes where a new account takes on the name of a recently deleted account.<br>3. Accounts created during the same timeframe as a legitimate account removal event. 4. Use of obfuscated or slight misspellings of common account names like 'help', 'support', or 'root'. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Does the account name closely resemble any existing accounts, particularly service accounts?<br>2. Was there a legitimate account removal event preceding the creation of the new account?<br>3. Are there any patterns indicating account creation during off-hours or from unusual locations? 4. Does the account name include slight misspellings or variations of common trusted names? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if the newly created account matches characteristics of a previously established threat pattern, such as alignment with known masquerade tactics or if multiple suspicious accounts are created in a short timeframe without a legitimate explanation. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Cross-reference account creation logs with account deletion logs to identify any patterns of masquerading.<br>2. Check the origin of account creation requests (e.g., IP addresses, geographical locations) for anomalies.<br>3. Review recent security patches and updates for potential exploitation of known vulnerabilities related to account management. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Conduct a thorough investigation of linked authentication activities: when and where has this account been accessed?<br>2. Analyze the new account's permissions and compare them to those of legitimate service accounts to assess unauthorized privilege escalation.<br>3. Evaluate historical logs for any lateral movement attempts using the suspected masquerade account. 4. Identify if any other suspicious accounts were created around the same time. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Immediately disable or quarantine the suspicious accounts while conducting a detailed assessment.<br>2. Review associated system and application logs for any unauthorized access attempts made using the account.<br>3. Conduct a comprehensive review of all recent account creations and deletions across the network environment. 4. Communicate findings with internal teams and, if necessary, external partners for coordinated threat mitigation. |
