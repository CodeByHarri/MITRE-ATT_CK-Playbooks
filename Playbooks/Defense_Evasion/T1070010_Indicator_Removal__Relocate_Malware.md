| Name | Indicator Removal: Relocate Malware |
| Log Sources to Investigate | File system logs to track creation and modification of files and directories, particularly new files in suspicious or uncommon locations; Endpoint detection and response (EDR) logs to identify unexpected file relocations; Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) logs to correlate events associated with file creation, modification, and deletion; Windows Event Logs, especially Event ID 4663 for file access changes; File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) systems for detecting unauthorized changes to critical paths. |
| Key Indicators | Presence of executables in non-standard directories (such as %AppData%, %LocalAppData%, %SystemRoot%, or temp directories); High frequency of file relocation activity involving the same executable; Newly created files with attributes matching known suspicious patterns (e.g., system file names but located in user directories); Absence of legitimate installer or package for new executable files detected; Files transitioning to or from listed malware quarantine directories. |
| Questions for Analysis | Are there multiple copies of the same executable appearing across different directories? Does the relocation happen immediately after an alert-triggering event, such as a detected phishing attempt? Are the file names trying to mimic system or user-critical files by naming convention or location? Are there associated file deletions following the relocations? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate if there are multiple detection events of the same file being moved, especially to high-risk directories or if attempts to run these files coincide with known attempts to evade detection; Escalate if legitimate processes cannot account for these relocations; Escalate if there is associated suspicious activity such as privilege escalation or unusual modifications in system configurations. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Check the hash of newly relocated files against known malware signatures; Validate file signatures and origins, considering signed files that do not match expected hash values; Review user permissions and processes that could have led to the file relocations; Investigate any accompanying file deletions or alterations that follow the relocation activity. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct deeper filesystem and process analysis to confirm malicious characteristics of relocated payloads; Utilize threat intelligence tools to match suspicious files with known indicators of compromise (IOCs); Perform memory analysis or forensic imaging if suspicious malware persistence mechanisms are identified; Examine loaded modules and network connections established by the suspicious files. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Isolate affected systems if confirmed malicious activity is detected; Quarantine suspicious files pending further investigation; Deploy antivirus or antimalware tools to eradicate identified threats; Monitor for further occurrences of similar relocation activities in the network; Implement preventive measures, such as tightening file access controls and security policies, to prevent future abuse of file relocation. |
