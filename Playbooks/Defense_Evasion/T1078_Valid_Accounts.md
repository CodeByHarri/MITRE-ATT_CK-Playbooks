| Name | Valid Accounts |
| Log Sources to Investigate | 1. Authentication Logs: Review logs from Active Directory, VPN, email systems like Outlook Web Access, and any SSO services where user logins are recorded.<br>2. Network Traffic Logs: Analyze logs from firewalls and intrusion detection systems to spot unusual login attempts or traffic patterns.<br>3. Cloud Service Logs: Look into logs from services like AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Logs, or GCP Audit Logs for irregular access patterns to cloud resources. 4. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Solutions: Check for unusual processes or connections made by recognized accounts on endpoints. 5. Identity and Access Management (IAM) Logs: Examine logs of account creation, deletions, permission changes, and failed login attempts. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Multiple failed login attempts for valid accounts, possibly followed by a successful attempt.<br>2. Logins from unfamiliar IP addresses or geolocations that do not match typical user behavior.<br>3. Access to systems or data that are atypical for the user account in question. 4. Use of an account that has been inactive or is associated with a former employee. 5. Unusual timing for access, such as logins occurring outside of normal business hours. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Is there evidence of multiple failed authentication attempts followed by a successful login for any account?<br>2. Does the login correspond to the user's known IP address or is it from a suspicious location?<br>3. Is the account activity consistent with the user's normal behavior and job function? 4. Are there any associated alerts for lateral movement or privilege escalation with the account in question? 5. Is the account's login associated with any known threat actor IP addresses or domains? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if: 1. There is evidence of successful authentication from a suspicious IP or location without a valid reason.<br>2. The account accesses sensitive data or systems that are beyond the intended use or job function.<br>3. The account is used outside normal operating hours and is associated with high-risk or sensitive operations. 4. There is corroborating evidence or alerts indicating potential lateral movement or privilege escalation. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Verify the IP address or geolocation of the login against known user locations using tools like Threat Intelligence Platforms.<br>2. Review user's historical login patterns for anomalies.<br>3. Cross-reference with logs from endpoint protection for unusual activity related to the account. 4. Confirm if the account is still active and flagged as not obsolete or belonging to a former employee. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Conduct deeper log analysis focusing on timelines and patterns associated with the suspected account activity.<br>2. Engage with system or network administrators to validate if the IP or location has legitimate access reasons.<br>3. Use threat intelligence feeds to cross-reference IPs or domains associated with access attempts. 4. Initiate potential forensic imaging or memory analysis of compromised workstations if local exposure is suspected. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Initiate a password reset or account lockout if credential compromise is suspected.<br>2. Monitor all continued activity from the account for additional suspicious behavior.<br>3. Invalidate any unauthorized sessions logged in from unexpected locations. 4. Work with HR or management to validate the employment status or usage legitimacy of suspected inactive accounts. 5. Make use of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on all accessible endpoints to prevent unauthorized future logins. |
