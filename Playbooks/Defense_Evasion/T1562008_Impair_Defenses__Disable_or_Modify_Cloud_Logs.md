| Name | Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Cloud Logs |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate cloud service provider logs such as AWS CloudTrail, AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor Logs, Azure Security Center, and Microsoft 365 Unified Audit Logs. Specifically, review logs for entries related to logging configuration changes, such as 'StopLogging' and 'DeleteTrail' for CloudTrail in AWS. Monitor Azure Activity Logs for 'Update Diagnostic Settings' or 'Delete Log Profile' operations. In Microsoft 365, search for activities related to changes in audit settings or user license changes, especially for Set-MailboxAuditBypassAssociation cmdlets. |
| Key Indicators | Key indicators include sudden disabling or modification of logging configurations, such as CloudTrail 'StopLogging' actions, deletion of log-related settings in Azure, and execution of Set-MailboxAuditBypassAssociation in Microsoft 365. Look for discrepancies in expected log generation times or sudden gaps in log records. Also, investigate any simultaneous or recent access to logging management interfaces followed by abnormal user account activities. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Has there been any unauthorized access to the accounts with privileges to modify logging settings?<br>2. Were there any configuration changes made to disable or reduce logging within a critical timeframe of other suspicious activities?<br>3. Are there any unexplained gaps in the logs or changes to audit configurations that coincide with high-risk timeframes? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if there is confirmed unauthorized access or changes to logging configurations, especially if this coincides with other suspicious activity. Also, escalate if you cannot determine the legitimacy of the changes, or if the implicated accounts have a limited history or are known threat vectors. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify the account(s) used to make the changes to log settings. Cross-reference recent log entries with known authorized change events. Check for any associated alert or previous incident that could explain the activity. Perform initial contact with involved users, if applicable, to validate actions. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | T2 analysts should conduct a more thorough investigation of the affected accounts, checking for additional unauthorized activity or privilege escalation. Verify whether the actions align with legitimate internal processes or operational changes. Engage with IT teams to identify any unusual patterns or similar incidents across the environment. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | If unauthorized activity is confirmed, re-enable log configurations immediately. Consider implementing conditional access policies to prevent further unauthorized changes. Review and update IAM policies to limit permissions for log management. Initiate a broader assessment to determine if this incident ties to a larger campaign or compromise. Engage with relevant stakeholders to review and possibly enhance the organization's monitoring configuration and incident response protocols. |
