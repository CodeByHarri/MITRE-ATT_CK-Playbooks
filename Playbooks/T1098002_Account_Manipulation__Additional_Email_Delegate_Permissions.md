| Name | Account Manipulation: Additional Email Delegate Permissions |
| Log Sources to Investigate | 1. Email logs from Exchange and Office 365: Look for any use of the 'Add-MailboxPermission' command, especially if executed by non-administrative users. <br>2. Administrative activity logs in Google Workspace: Check Google Admin console logs for any delegation settings changes. <br>3. Access and permissions logs: Review logs for changes in permissions to user mailboxes and folders, focusing on Default or Anonymous user settings in Office 365.<br>4. Cloud monitoring solutions: Analysis of changes in permission assignments or role modifications. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Use of 'Add-MailboxPermission' cmdlet by unusual or non-administrative accounts.<br>2. Sudden changes in mailbox permissions granting Delegate Access or additional roles.<br>3. Assigning Default or Anonymous permissions to sensitive folders such as Inbox or root in Office 365.<br>4. Unusual access patterns such as logins from out-of-region IPs or devices.<br>5. Spike in internal email forwarding or inbox rule creation shortly after permission changes. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Was the 'Add-MailboxPermission' command executed by a legitimate administrator?<br>2. Are there any unusual patterns or recent changes in access rights to email folders?<br>3. Have there been any alerts of suspicious logins or activities around the same time?<br>4. Are there notable deviations in email activity or frequency of delegation changes?<br>5. Were any business-critical mailboxes affected by these permissions changes? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if: <br>1. The 'Add-MailboxPermission' or similar admin commands were used by non-administrative or suspicious accounts.<br>2. There are concurrent anomalies in account usage such as unexpected logins or phishing attempts from addressed compromised accounts.<br>3. Unauthorized assignment of Default or Anonymous permissions is detected, especially in sensitive folders. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Verify the identity and roles of user accounts executing 'Add-MailboxPermission'.<br>2. Cross-reference permission alterations with recent login events to check for anomalies.<br>3. Analyze sharing settings in Gmail for any unusual delegates added.<br>4. Check for related alerts or recent similar incidents within the environment. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Conduct deeper analysis of account activity logs to correlate permission changes with user behavior.<br>2. Validate the legitimacy of roles and permissions assigned during the period of interest.<br>3. Engage the account owner to confirm whether changes were authorized.<br>4. Utilize threat intelligence to determine if the behavior matches known adversarial TTPs. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Revoke unauthorized permissions immediately and reset affected accounts.<br>2. Conduct a comprehensive review of mailbox delegation and access policies.<br>3. Tighten monitoring on the affected accounts for any signs of persistence or further compromises.<br>4. If possible, revert any unauthorized rule changes, and block any known malicious IPs or indicators.<br>5. Increase awareness and communication about potential BEC attacks targeting the organization. |
