| Name | Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Re-opened Applications |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Monitor file system activity focused on the user's Library directory, specifically '~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/'. Track changes to '.plist' files, especially modifications to 'com.apple.loginwindow.[UUID].plist'. Utilize endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to capture process execution logs that show which applications are automatically starting. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems should parse these logs for 'launchctl' or 'plutil' interactions, often indicative of plist modification. |
| Key Indicators | Look for anomalies in the 'com.apple.loginwindow.[UUID].plist' files such as unexpected or unusual application paths, execution permissions that are not standard for user login processes, or changes that coincide with other suspicious activities. Monitor for repeated or unauthorized access to 'launchctl' and 'plutil' in terminal sessions, as these are often linked to plist file alterations. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Is the application path in the plist file recognized and expected behavior for the specific user?<br>2. Are there any other associated alerts or indicators of compromise on this system?<br>3. Has the user reported any unusual computer behavior recently? 4. Does the timing of the plist modification correspond with the user's known activities and work schedule? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if the application paths are unknown or the changes are unauthorized, indicating potential malware or persistence mechanisms. Also, escalate if simultaneous alerts from the EDR tool suggest possible compromise patterns, or if there are multiple user reports of unusual system behavior. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify the user profile associated with the plist file modification. Cross-reference with software inventory to understand if the application path is part of a legitimate or newly installed software. Check recent login attempts and specific process executions around the time of modification. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct a deeper inspection of the file integrity, checking hash values against known malware signatures. Investigate network activity from the host around the time of modification for any suspicious outbound connections. Perform a timeline analysis of other system activities surrounding the event to spot any coordinated attack patterns. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | If an unauthorized or suspicious application path is identified, quarantine the affected application or file. Revert the plist file to a known good state if possible. Implement host containment strategies to prevent lateral movement by the adversary. Follow up with a comprehensive malware scan and analyze the system for additional persistence mechanisms. Ensure security patches and updates are applied to prevent exploitation of similar persistence vectors. |
