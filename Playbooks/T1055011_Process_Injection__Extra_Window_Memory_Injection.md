| Name | Process Injection: Extra Window Memory Injection |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate logs from endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to monitor for EWM API function calls such as GetWindowLong and SetWindowLong. Review application logs for unusual registration of new window classes or modifications to existing ones. Also, check Windows event logs for security events related to process creation and memory access, such as Event ID 4688 (Process Creation), and Event ID 7031 (Service Control Manager events). Network logs should be checked to identify unusual traffic from processes suspected to have undergone EWM injection. |
| Key Indicators | Look for unusual or unexpected usage of GetWindowLong and SetWindowLong functions. Monitor for anomalous changes in window class registrations that could suggest EWM manipulation. Identify processes that suddenly start showing unexpected behavior, such as spawning additional child processes, establishing network connections, or consuming increased resources. Detect the lack of standard API calls like WriteProcessMemory and CreateRemoteThread when malicious activity is suspected. |
| Questions for Analysis | Is there a legitimate reason for a process to use EWM-related API calls? Are the processes involved known legitimate applications, or are they lesser-known executables? Are there any accompanying signs of compromise or other suspicious activities related to the process in question? Is there a historical pattern of behavior for the involved processes, and does this current activity deviate from the norm? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if the EWM API calls are associated with high-value assets or critical business applications, or if the processes involved are exhibiting other suspicious behaviors such as network connections to rare or foreign IP addresses, unexpected privilege escalations, or match known signatures of malicious behavior. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Conduct a review of recent file system changes and check for entry points that could have triggered this behavior, such as new installed applications or updates. Validate the digital signatures and normal operation patterns of the involved processes. Cross-reference the related processes and sequences of events to known threat intelligence feeds. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Perform a deeper dive into memory analysis to identify injected code and its intentions. Examine process memory dumps for unexpected code sections that are not part of the normal execution. Use advanced EDR capabilities to trace back the origin of the EWM function calls, looking for potential staging or dropper activities. Correlate across network logs for lateral movement indicators. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent potential propagation. Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the compromised endpoint to remove any malware artifacts and identify any additional persistence mechanisms. Update the detection rules and threat intelligence database to prevent future attacks utilizing similar techniques. Monitor the broader network for any additional instances of similar behavior and take preemptive actions as necessary. |
