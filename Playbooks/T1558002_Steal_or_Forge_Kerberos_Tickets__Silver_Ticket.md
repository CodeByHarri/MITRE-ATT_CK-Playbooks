| Name | Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets: Silver Ticket |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate Windows Security Event Logs, particularly focusing on Event ID 4678 (A session was reconnected to a Window Station) and Event ID 4769 (A Kerberos service ticket was requested). Examine the Domain Controller logs for any anomalies in ticket requests that do not correspond to normal user activity. Review Active Directory logs for unusual service account authentications. Additionally, collect and analyze network traffic for unusual Kerberos traffic patterns, specifically for traffic that suggests ticket reuse or ticket requests without corresponding requests to the KDC. |
| Key Indicators | Unusual frequency of Event ID 4769 for specific service accounts in a short period. Service tickets for legitimate users but without corresponding pre-authentication evidence. Kerberos tickets without requests seen at the KDC. Abnormal access patterns to sensitive resources such as MSSQL, SharePoint through service accounts. Anomalies in service account password hash dumps detected through credential dumping techniques. |
| Questions for Analysis | Are there any anomalies in the Kerberos ticket requests corresponding to service accounts? Are there discrepancies between Kerberos TGS requests and KDC logs? Do logs show service account access to resources or systems they typically do not interact with? Are there any indicators of service account hash dumping activities in OS Credential Dumping or Kerberoasting logs? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if there are confirmed anomalies in Kerberos ticket logs indicating a ticket was potentially forged, if there are any signs of credential dumping activities, or if there are unauthorized access attempts to sensitive systems using service accounts. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Correlate service ticket requests with known service account actions and normal behavior. Cross-reference with past login activities for service accounts to establish a normal baseline. Engage with Active Directory logs to verify ticket request legitimacy. Validate the timelines of activities to check for concurrent suspicious actions. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Perform a deep dive into the Kerberos ticketing to confirm the authenticity of the observed tickets. Capture and analyze network traffic for any indications of pass-the-ticket attacks. Investigate endpoint logs on machines generating abnormal Kerberos traffic for signs of compromise. Review historical logs to trace back the origin of the attack to determine whether the initial access point has been remediated. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further lateral movement. Reset affected service account passwords and force ticket invalidation. Conduct a comprehensive audit of service accounts for unauthorized changes or activity. Implement stricter monitoring on Kerberos authentication requests and bolster defenses against ticket harvesting techniques. Engage in threat hunting activities across the network to look for indications of a broader compromise. |
