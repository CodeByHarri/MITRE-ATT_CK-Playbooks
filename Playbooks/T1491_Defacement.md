| Name | Defacement |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Web server logs for unexpected modifications, CMS activity logs to detect unauthorized changes, file integrity monitoring system alerts for alterations to web content, user activity logs for unusual access patterns or privilege escalations, source control systems for unexpected commits or changes, application firewall logs to detect possible web exploitation attempts. |
| Key Indicators | Unexpected changes in website content or appearance, file integrity alerts indicating unauthorized modifications, increased access or privilege use outside of business hours, anomalies in the CMS logs indicating unauthorized administrative activities, discovery of controversial, offensive, or threatening content on web assets, evidence of source code or web asset changes not authorized by the development team. |
| Questions for Analysis | Are there any logs showing activity outside of normal administrative user behaviors? Do the file changes align with authorized content deployments? Are there new or unexpected accounts or IP addresses accessing the web management interfaces? Have there been recent vulnerabilities reported in the web platform or CMS? Was there any unusual network traffic or inbound connection attempts associated with web servers? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if unauthorized changes are confirmed and linked to suspicious activity, if there is evidence of exploitation techniques or tools associated with defacement behaviors, or if the changes are associated with an ongoing or recently observed threat campaign or intrusion. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify current website appearance versus the expected version using approved sources like internal documentation or backups, gather a list of all recent changes and compare against scheduled updates, check access logs for accounts with failed login attempts around the time of content changes, identify any anomalies in administrative access patterns or IP geolocation that donâ€™t align with expected behavior. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct deeper forensic analysis on compromised or altered web assets, cross-reference with threat intelligence sources to identify potential actors or similar incidents, analyze the CMS and application server configurations for security gaps or exploitation vectors, assess network traffic for signs of data exfiltration or other compromise indicators, confirm whether unauthorized changes have been contained and rolled back. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Immediately restore content to its original state from known good backups, lock down access to the CMS and any affected systems, update all relevant passwords or access credentials involved in the service, perform a full integrity check on related systems to ensure no other modifications occurred, conduct vulnerability assessments and patch any exploitable weaknesses, consider deploying additional monitoring or security controls to prevent future similar incidents. |
