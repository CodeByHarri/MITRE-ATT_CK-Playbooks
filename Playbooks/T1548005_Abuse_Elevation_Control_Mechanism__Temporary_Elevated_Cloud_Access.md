| Name | Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Temporary Elevated Cloud Access |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate cloud provider logs that capture permission changes, role assignments, and API calls related to identity and access management. Key log sources include AWS CloudTrail for tracking IAM role-related activities and use of PassRole permission, GCP Audit Logs for service account impersonation and iam.serviceAccountUser activities, Azure Activity Logs for any Just-in-Time (JIT) access requests, approvals or rejections, Exchange Online Audit Logs for ApplicationImpersonation actions, and any custom logs capturing changes to cloud identity permissions or role grants. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Creation or request of Just-in-Time access without prior notifications or approvals.<br>2. Use of rarely exercised impersonation roles or permissions by users or service accounts outside normal operational hours.<br>3. Changes involving 'PassRole' permissions or 'iam.serviceAccountUser' actions tied to non-standard projects, resources, or users. 4. Utilization of the ApplicationImpersonation role or similar across multiple user accounts in a short period. 5. Access tokens created for impersonated accounts, especially if unprecedented or anomalous in historical usage data. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Does the user or service account initiating the action have a historical pattern of requesting elevated access?<br>2. Is there a legitimate business requirement for the requested temporary elevated access?<br>3. Are there any associated alerts from anomaly detection or unusual activity in related services or accounts? 4. Have there been any recent policy changes affecting access requests or permissions? 5. Is this activity occurring outside of normal business hours or from unusual locations or devices? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if the analysis identifies access requests or impersonations that are: 1. conducted outside usual business hours, 2. conducted by users without a history of elevated access requests, 3. lack corresponding business justification, 4. associated with multiple accounts in a close timeframe suggestive of lateral movement, or 5. linked with concurrent alerts or detection signals from other security systems. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Validate the timestamps, users, and roles involved in the elevated access requests or impersonations.<br>2. Cross-reference the activity with known baselines or expected patterns for the users or service accounts involved.<br>3. Confirm if there are outstanding requests for this action in any IT support ticketing system. 4. Check for any recent or pending organizational changes that might legitimize these actions. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Perform a detailed review of access logs to validate the legitimacy of the actions and identify patterns or indicators of compromise (IOCs).<br>2. Investigate the context of recent role or permission changes and correlate with organizational changes or known good configurations.<br>3. Contact the involved business units or system owners to verify the legitimacy of the elevated access. 4. Implement or recommend monitoring for similar patterns across the cloud environment to detect recurrence. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Temporarily revoke the elevated access and monitor for any immediate impact or response.<br>2. Notify the relevant account holders and request verification of their recent activities.<br>3. Engage incident response to assess the extent of potential compromise or lateral movement. 4. Strengthen monitoring and detection capabilities for permission escalations across cloud environments. 5. Review and tighten associated IAM policies and practices to prevent misconfigurations enabling such abuses. |
