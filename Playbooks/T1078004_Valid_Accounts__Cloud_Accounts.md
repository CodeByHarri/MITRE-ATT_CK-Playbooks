| Name | Valid Accounts: Cloud Accounts |
| Log Sources to Investigate | 1. Cloud service provider logs (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Logs, Google Cloud Logs) to identify unusual login patterns or configuration changes.<br>2. Authentication logs, particularly for federated identity services, to detect irregular access attempts.<br>3. Cloud API logs for unauthorized API calls that may suggest exploitation or privilege escalations. 4. Detailed access logs from SaaS applications to monitor actions performed with cloud accounts. 5. Network logs that may indicate unusual data transfer activity between cloud and on-premises environments. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Logins from unusual geolocations or IP addresses not typical for the user mix.<br>2. Repeated failed authentication attempts suggesting brute force attacks.<br>3. Unscheduled role changes or elevated access granting in cloud account configurations. 4. Creation of potentially illicit cloud credentials without corresponding human verification. 5. Anomalous data access patterns indicating privilege misuse. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Are there any repeated failed logins from an unfamiliar location linked to a high-privilege account?<br>2. Are there any new credentials created without formal user initiation?<br>3. Is there any activity suggesting privilege escalation, such as role changes or policy amendments? 4. Were there any attempts to bypass MFA settings or indications of access using alternate credentials? |
| Decision for Escalation | If the analysis identifies successful unauthorized logins, abnormal geographical access patterns involving privileged accounts, unscheduled changes to sensitive configurations, or the creation of unauthorized credentials, escalate the incident to Tier 2 for an in-depth investigation. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Confirm the legitimacy of the alerted account activity by contacting the account owners or evaluating suspiciousness of logs.<br>2. Validate whether MFA or other security controls were bypassed.<br>3. Assess the timeline of events to determine any correlation in unauthorized access patterns or credentials misuse. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Conduct a deeper audit of the affected account's activity to assess any further unauthorized actions.<br>2. Coordinate with cloud security teams to review and contain any rogue cloud resources or credentials.<br>3. Implement monitoring for further anomalies potentially indicating continued adversary presence. 4. Support IR team in identifying indicators of a broader attack impacting other accounts or environments. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Revoke any suspiciously created credentials and enforce password resets for impacted accounts.<br>2. Strengthen access control measures, like tightening network access control lists (ACLs) and enforcing stricter MFA policies.<br>3. Analyze aggregate logs to seek related instances reflective of the breach pattern across the environment. 4. Initiate a post-incident review to update policies and improve detection capabilities. |
