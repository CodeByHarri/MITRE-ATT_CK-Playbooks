| Name | System Binary Proxy Execution: Odbcconf |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate Windows Event Logs, particularly Event ID 4688 for new process creation events which can show command-line execution referencing odbcconf.exe. Check Windows system logs for any unexpected or suspicious DLL registration activity specifically linked to odbcconf.exe, and review application control logs if they are in place as they might indicate a bypass attempt. Collect and examine logs from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions for indicators of execution via odbcconf.exe in unusual circumstances. |
| Key Indicators | Use of odbcconf.exe with the /A {REGSVR flag and a path to a DLL file, especially in non-standard directories like C:\Users\Public. High frequency of execution of odbcconf.exe in a short time span. Execution of odbcconf.exe without corresponding legitimate ODBC configuration changes. Presence of suspiciously named or located DLL files that are registered via odbcconf.exe. |
| Questions for Analysis | Is odbcconf.exe executing with the /A {REGSVR flag? Are the associated DLL files located in unexpected paths (e.g., C:\Users\Public)? Are there any correlating logs or alerts that suggest lateral movement or credential dumping occurring in the environment? Have there been recent configuration changes that justify the use of odbcconf.exe? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if odbcconf.exe is found executing the /A {REGSVR flag without legitimate administrative activity or in conjunction with known adversary tactics or compromise indicators, such as anomalous DLL path or concurrent suspicious activities. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Perform a process lineage review to determine the parent process of odbcconf.exe. Cross-reference execution times with the user login history to ascertain unusual execution patterns. Search through historical logs for similar events to determine if this is an isolated incident or part of a broader pattern. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of the system executing odbcconf.exe to gather more context on the associated DLL files. Analyze network traffic for outbound connections immediately following odbcconf.exe execution to determine if the actions are tied to further lateral movement or data exfiltration activities. Review file integrity and query antivirus and EDR solutions for the presence of known malware associated with the detected patterns. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Isolate the affected endpoint from the network to prevent further malicious operations. Conduct a comprehensive malware scan of the system using a combination of antivirus and targeted scripts. If malicious activity is confirmed, analyze similar endpoints to identify potential lateral movement or replication. Further, analyze the flagged DLL file for malicious characteristics through behavioral analysis in a sandbox environment. Document all findings and correlate with other system and network activities as part of a broader compromise assessment. |
