| Log Sources to Investigate | Monitor file system event logs that track creation and modification of files, specifically focusing on those involving NTFS alternate data streams. Investigate alerts from Windows Defender and other anti-virus software for activities related to downloads marked with MOTW. Check network logs for evidence of downloads from external sources, focusing on container files like .arj, .gzip, .iso, and .vhd. Observing extraction activities via application logs such as WinRAR, WinZip, or mounting utilities like Daemon Tools or PowerISO can provide additional context. SIEM solutions with correlation capabilities can help in consolidating these observations. |
| Key Indicators | Files downloaded from the web marked with MOTW, especially containers (.iso, .vhd, etc.). Extraction or mounting of container files followed by execution of files that bypass MOTW controls. Process creation events where the parent process is an extraction utility or mounting tool, yet the child processes are suspicious executables without MOTW. Anomalous traffic patterns associated with recent downloads, particularly where files appear valuable but are not interacting as expected with security controls like Smartscreen. |
| Questions for Analysis | Was the file downloaded recently and tagged with MOTW? Was there any user action that extracted or mounted the container file? Did the executable run without expected MOTW-related prompts or protective warnings? Are there historical patterns of similar file types executing on this endpoint? Did the user report any unexpected behavior after file interaction? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate if extraction or mounting of downloaded files is followed by the execution of new or unusual programs on the endpoint that bypass security controls. Evidence of potential lateral movement or any direct impact on integrity, confidentiality, or availability should be prioritized. Lack of adequate logging preventing full analysis also warrants further investigation by Tier 2. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Correlate file download logs with extracted/mounted file activities to identify potential MOTW bypass incidents. Establish a timeline for when the suspicious activity began and identify the source if possible. Ensure anti-virus solutions are operational and check for alerts post-execution of extracted contents. Verify user intention and business use-case for opening such files. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Perform in-depth analysis of the endpoint involved, utilizing EDR solutions to investigate for lateral movement or persistence mechanisms. Analyze extracted files in a controlled and safe environment to determine their behavior. Check for any signs of network communication patterns to command and control infrastructures. Review recent changes to system files and registry entries for malicious modifications. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Quarantine the affected endpoint as necessary to prevent further spread. Use network segmentation strategies for immediate containment of suspicious traffic. Recover affected files from backups or shadow copies, and patch any vulnerabilities during forensic analysis. Provide user training on safe handling of files downloaded from the internet to mitigate future threats. Share the IoCs (Indicators of Compromise) identified during analysis with the broader security team to enhance prevention capabilities. |
