| Name | Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: XDG Autostart Entries |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Examine file creation and modification events in the ~/.config/autostart and /etc/xdg/autostart directories. Check shell command history and process execution logs, focusing on unexpected or unusual `.desktop` file updates. Utilize inotify or similar tools to monitor file system changes. Inspect logs from security information and event management (SIEM) systems for anomalies related to XDG Autostart file activity. Example log sources include syslog, auditd logs, or logs from endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions that capture file and process activity on Linux endpoints. |
| Key Indicators | Presence of new or modified `.desktop` files in the autostart directories, especially those with unusual or unexpected `Exec` entries. Disparities or anomalies in file permissions of `.desktop` files. Execution of unfamiliar or suspicious binaries at user logon. Entries in the `Exec` directive that point to non-standard paths or applications, particularly those located in temporary directories or home directories. |
| Questions for Analysis | Does the `.desktop` file contain an `Exec` path that is known and expected for the system? Are there recent changes to the autostart directories that align with known user activity or system updates? Is there any obfuscation in the file names or commands used in the `.desktop` files? Have similar entries been observed across multiple systems or user accounts simultaneously? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate if the `.desktop` file executes known malicious applications or commands. Escalate if investigations reveal simultaneous changes across multiple systems without legitimate cause. Escalate if there is obfuscation in the `.desktop` files, such as unfamiliar file names or masked commands. Escalate if prior notification or system update logs do not account for the changes. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify the legitimacy of new or modified `.desktop` entries by cross-referencing file and user modification logs. Compare the modified `.desktop` files with known good configurations or baselines. Use threat intelligence sources to determine whether the applications called in the `Exec` directive have been previously linked to malicious activity. Validate recent system changes with IT or system administrators. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of the `.desktop` files, focusing on the associated applications and command-line arguments. Correlate the malware executables with known signatures or behavior patterns using advanced threat intelligence platforms. Perform timeline analysis to understand the sequence of events leading to file modifications. Ensure coordination with incident response teams if confirmed as malicious. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Quarantine affected systems from the network to prevent further propagation or execution of malicious binaries. Remove or revert unauthorized changes to `.desktop` files in autostart directories. Use network and endpoint-based indicators to search for lateral movement or additional compromises. Perform root cause analysis to determine how the autostart entry was compromised and apply necessary remediations or policy changes. |
