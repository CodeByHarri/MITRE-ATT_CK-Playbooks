| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate logs from centralized software deployment tools like SCCM, Intune, and AWS Systems Manager. Include logs from network management consoles, and CI/CD pipeline logs where applicable. Look for command execution logs and endpoint management activities. Additionally, review cloud management service logs and network infrastructure device logs, focusing on login attempts and configuration changes. Examples of specific log types include Windows Event Logs for SCCM operations, AWS CloudTrail logs for Systems Manager activities, and Azure Activity Logs for Azure Arc operations. |
| Key Indicators | Unusual or unauthorized execution of scripts or commands across multiple endpoints; irregular login attempts or use of service accounts for software deployment tools; initiation of deployment tasks outside of regular maintenance windows; anomalies in configuration management services such as unapproved changes or odd timing of tasks; use of administrative credentials in atypical patterns. |
| Questions for Analysis | Is there a known scheduled maintenance or update that could explain the observed behavior? Are the activities aligned with normal business operations or an approved change request? Do the involved accounts have the necessary permissions and are they expected to use them in this manner? Is there any evidence of scripts being executed that are not typically used by IT administrators? Are there any external IP addresses interacting with the endpoint management tools? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if the behavior is unusual and not explained by legitimate IT activities, such as systems being accessed by unexpected accounts or during unusual hours, or if there are signs that administrative credentials might be compromised. Escalation is also required if thereâ€™s confirmation of malicious scripts being executed. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Check for the times and locations of login attempts to identify abnormal patterns. Cross-reference any observed account activities with previous logs to determine if the behavior is typical for that user. Review any recent changes to permissions or system configurations that might indicate unauthorized access or privilege escalation. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Verify the legitimacy of the login events and command executions by contacting the account owners or associated personnel. Correlate the activity with known threat intelligence. Investigate deeper into the configuration management tool's logs for any anomalies. Review historical changes for the involved accounts or systems to spot ongoing or repeated suspicious activity. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | If malicious activity is confirmed, consider isolating affected systems to prevent further lateral movement. Rotate credentials for compromised accounts and implement multi-factor authentication if not already enabled. Conduct a thorough audit of all configuration management tool activities, and ensure all systems managed by these tools are searched for unauthorized changes or deployments. Employ network segmentation to reduce the risk of lateral movement and apply patches and updates to affected systems to close any exploited vulnerabilities. Continue monitoring for any resurgence of similar tactics or patterns of behavior. |
