| Name | Account Manipulation |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Log sources relevant to detecting Account Manipulation (T1098) include:<br>1. **Windows Security Event Logs**: Monitor Event ID 4720 (A user account was created), Event ID 4738 (A user account was changed), Event ID 4722 (A user account was enabled), and Event ID 4732 (A member was added to a security-enabled local group).<br>2. **Active Directory Logs**: Review changes in AD, especially additions or modifications to user accounts and group memberships, through logs and change audits.<br>3. **Endpoint Detection Logs**: Investigate logs from endpoint security solutions that may reveal unauthorized account modifications.<br>4. **Cloud Management Logs**: Inspect logs from cloud services like AWS CloudTrail, Microsoft 365 Audit logs for account changes or unexpected configuration updates.<br>5. **SIEM Alerts**: Analyze alerts that correlate account creation, permission changes, or abnormal authentication attempts. |
| Key Indicators | Key indicators of potential Account Manipulation include:<br>1. Creation of new accounts during non-business hours.<br>2. Unusual changes in account membership to privileged groups.<br>3. Multiple failed or successful login attempts from unusual locations or IPs.<br>4. Rapid series of password changes on a single account.<br>5. Unexpected activity or logins associated with dormant or unused accounts. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Is there a legitimate purpose or request for the account change observed?<br>2. Are the account changes occurring outside normal business hours or from unusual locations?<br>3. Is there a pattern of account creation, modification, or deletion that deviates from normal organizational behavior?<br>4. Are privileged accounts being manipulated or created without formal authorization?<br>5. Is there evidence of lateral movement or further compromise related to the changed accounts? |
| Decision for Escalation | 1. Escalate if unauthorized account modifications to privileged accounts or access to sensitive data are confirmed.<br>2. Escalate if suspicious account activity correlates with other indicators of compromise (IoCs) or concurrent anomalies.<br>3. Escalate if there is evidence of bypassing security policies, such as policy-defined password constraints.<br>4. Escalate if data exfiltration or impact on critical business operations is suspected. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Verify if the account changes align with any known or documented IT policies or approved changes.<br>2. Use a SIEM to correlate suspicious log events with other anomalous activities.<br>3. Contact the account owner or IT personnel to validate the legitimacy of any recent requests or changes.<br>4. Monitor network traffic associated with the modified or suspicious accounts for unusual behavior. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Perform a comprehensive audit of account change activities across impacted systems, focusing on those with administrative privileges.<br>2. Investigate other potentially compromised accounts or credentials using Threat Intelligence enrichment.<br>3. Review historical logs to identify patterns or previous instances of similar account manipulation attempts.<br>4. Employ network analysis tools to ascertain any external communications or data exfiltration attempts post-account manipulation. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Use endpoint security tools to isolate systems where unauthorized account manipulations occurred.<br>2. Temporarily disable suspicious accounts and reset credentials as a precautionary measure.<br>3. Conduct a full memory and disk analysis of affected endpoints to locate additional malware or persistence mechanisms.<br>4. Review and refine access policies and implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for sensitive account access.<br>5. Assess potential data loss or impact incidents via forensic analysis and appropriate data loss prevention (DLP) solutions. |
