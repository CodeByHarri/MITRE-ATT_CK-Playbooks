| Name | Data Obfuscation: Steganography |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate network traffic logs for anomalies or suspicious data patterns. Check web proxy logs for unusually high traffic of image or document files that do not fit the typical traffic profile for the organization. Review IDS/IPS alerts for potential steganographic tool usage or known signatures. Examine endpoint security tools for indications of steganography software installation or execution. Examples include firewall logs showing atypical outbound traffic, DNS logs for abnormal querying patterns, and system logs for unexpected file creation or modification activities. |
| Key Indicators | Large volume of file transfers involving image or document files over communication channels. Infrequent or sudden increase in the number of legitimate-looking images being transmitted. Presence of known steganography tools or libraries on endpoints, such as OpenStego, Steghide, or ImageMagick. Anomalous file entropy indicating potential data embedded within images or documents. Network packets with unexpected data patterns or payload size inconsistent with their file type. |
| Questions for Analysis | Is there a discernible pattern in the transferred images or files that coincides with known malicious activity? Do the time and source of the unusual data transfer correspond with other detected anomalies or alerts? Have any of the users or systems involved in the transfer previously been flagged for suspicious activity? Is there evidence of steganography tools or software installations on the systems involved? Are there any signs of compromised email or messaging accounts being used for the transfer? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if the data transfer involves high-risk systems or assets, steganographic tools are confirmed on an endpoint, there is a match with known threat actor TTPs, or when initial analysis confirms network traffic anomalies that are highly suspicious or unexplained after preliminary checks. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Correlate the suspicious data transfers with current threat intelligence reports for any relevant indicators. Verify the legitimacy of the sender and the receiver of the data transfers. Check for any alarming file modifications or atypical use of image or document files across other systems. Look for any historical patterns of similar data transfers. Validate timestamps and metadata of any potential steganographic files for inconsistencies or unusual attributes. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Perform a deeper packet analysis to decode potential steganographic payloads using specialized tools. Conduct a threat hunt to identify any propagation of similar files across the network. Leverage threat intelligence platforms to match identified indicators with known actors or campaigns. Engage with incident response teams for a comprehensive investigation if the threat level is confirmed to be high. Analyze the presence and usage patterns of any installed steganographic tools to assess scope and impact. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Isolate affected systems to prevent further data exfiltration. Deploy updated IDS/IPS signatures to detect and block known steganography-related traffic and tools. Conduct forensic analysis of affected systems to retrieve hidden data and comprehend the scope of the breach. Patch vulnerabilities that might have been exploited to facilitate the steganography-based attack. Engage with legal teams and authorities if the breach results in significant data loss or involves sensitive information. |
