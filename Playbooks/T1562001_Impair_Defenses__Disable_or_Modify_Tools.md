| Name | Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Review logs from security tools that may be modified or disabled, such as endpoint detection and response (EDR) logs, SIEM alerts with security tool status changes, Windows Event Logs (specifically, Sysmon logs and events related to service state changes), Registry change logs, and network device configuration change logs. It is also crucial to examine cloud environment monitoring logs (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Google Cloud Monitoring) for any sudden shutdown or configuration change entries. |
| Key Indicators | Indicators include unexpected termination or status change of antivirus/antimalware processes, unauthorized modifications in security tool configurations or registry paths (e.g., changes to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\WMI\Autologger), unusual network traffic patterns suggesting remote tampering of tools, evidence of security tool installation path modifications, logs showing unauthorized disabling of cloud monitoring agents, and usage of known rootkit removal or exploitation tools like GMER without legitimate reasons. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Are there recent changes in the configuration of endpoint security tools or their service statuses? <br>2. Was there any unexpected shutdown or modification to key log settings, such as Sysmon configurations? <br>3. Do the logs indicate any unauthorized registry or file changes linked to key security tools? <br>4. Are cloud monitoring tools reporting unusual or no activity from specific services? <br>5. Is there evidence of specific tools, like GMER, being used without legitimate operations being documented? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if there is evidence of unauthorized modification of security configurations, especially if changes align with known patterns of tampering, if suspicious tools are used without justification, or if critical systems show signs of compromised monitoring capabilities. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify the user credentials associated with any configuration changes. Cross-reference changes with recent IT operations or updates. Check with IT operations if there are scheduled maintenance activities. Validate configuration and service change requests with maintenance records. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct deeper forensic analysis to verify the processes/programs that initiated changes. Investigate the method and timing of unauthorized actions. Compare current security tool configurations with baselines. Employ threat intelligence to correlate actions with known malicious campaigns. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Contain affected systems by isolating them from the network. Assess whether critical updates were missed during the tampering period. Ensure all security tools are correctly reinstalled and reconfigured. Evaluate if comprehensive sweeps for rootkits or other stealth mechanisms across impacted systems are necessary. Initiate scans to identify broader compromise in the infrastructure. Implement stricter policies or toolset deployments to prevent similar bypass attempts. |
