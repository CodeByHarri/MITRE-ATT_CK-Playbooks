| Name | OS Credential Dumping: Proc Filesystem |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate system logs related to process operations such as /var/log/syslog, /var/log/auth.log (for unauthorized or root privilege accesses), and process accounting logs (e.g., auditd logs for process execution events). Additionally, focus on file access logs for /proc filesystem read operations and usage of tools that might perform memory scraping like grep, mimipenguin, etc. Collect and analyze network logs for unusual outbound traffic that could indicate exfiltration. |
| Key Indicators | Presence of unusual read operations on /proc/<PID>/maps or /proc/<PID>/mem by unexpected or unauthorized processes. Execution of commands like grep with patterns targeting memory addresses, particularly when executed with root privileges. Anomalous process activity involving known credential scraping tools (e.g., mimipenguin). Network activity to suspicious or unexpected external IPs following memory scraping operations. |
| Questions for Analysis | What process is accessing the /proc filesystem, and is it expected behavior for the user or system configuration? Are there indications of privilege escalation associated with the process in question? Is there a legitimate task being performed that requires access to /proc/mem or /proc/maps? Are there any known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by the process attempting to dump credentials? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if the process accessing /proc differs from known safe baselines and is unable to be explained by routine or legitimate operations. Escalate if root access is detected without a verified change control ticket or authorization. Escalate if detected access aligns with known malicious patterns/tools like mimipenguin. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify the legitimacy of process activity and their owners by checking against baselines and historical usage. Review any recent changes to system configurations or user accounts. Gather additional context concerning recent system updates, installed applications, or executed scripts. Correlate findings with threat intelligence feeds for known exploitation techniques pertaining to /proc credential scraping. Check system for presence of tools like mimipenguin or similar credential dumping utilities. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct deeper forensic analysis of the involved processes and memory dumps. Determine whether any sensitive information was successfully extracted. Cross-reference any potential indicators of compromise with threat intelligence databases. Analyze network data in more detail for any suspicious exfiltration attempts. If applicable, reverse engineer any malicious binaries or scripts discovered to understand their full capability. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Determine if containment is warranted; this can involve isolating the affected systems or killing malicious processes. Conduct a full system scan for additional artifacts related to credential scraping activities. Change credentials for any compromised accounts immediately being cautious for potential password reuse issues. Assess if other segments of the IT environment could also be vulnerable to similar attacks. Strengthen the monitoring and alerting mechanisms around process activities, especially those involving the /proc filesystem, to prevent future incidents. |
