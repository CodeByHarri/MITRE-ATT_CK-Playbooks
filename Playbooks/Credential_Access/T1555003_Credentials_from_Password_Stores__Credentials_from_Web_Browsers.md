| Name | Credentials from Password Stores: Credentials from Web Browsers |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate logs associated with file access and read operations for web browser directories such as AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\ and similar paths for other browsers like Firefox, Edge, and Safari. Review application logs related to credential management tools and Windows API calls, particularly focusing on 'CryptUnprotectData' invocation logs. Also, check for process execution logs involving SQL queries targeting browser database files. Monitor anomalies in network traffic logs if credentials are being exfiltrated, such as unexpected data transfers to external IP addresses. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools can also help in identifying suspicious process behavior related to this TTP. |
| Key Indicators | Unusual access to database files in browser directories, execution of SQL queries targeting browser credential stores. Calls to Windows API 'CryptUnprotectData' not associated with legitimate user or system processes. Unexplained network connections following browser data access activities. Unauthorized process injections or scans of browser process memory. |
| Questions for Analysis | Was there unauthorized access to browser credential files? Did any non-browser processes query or access these files? Are there unexpected calls to Windows 'CryptUnprotectData' API? Is there any network traffic that seems to follow the pattern of credential exfiltration? Are the observed activities linked to known applications or unusual for the timeframe? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate if thereâ€™s evidence of unauthorized access to credential storage files, unusual 'CryptUnprotectData' API calls, or incongruent network behaviors suggestive of data exfiltration. Any observed access by unverified or suspicious processes warrants escalation. Confirm any pattern of behavior that correlates across multiple systems. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Confirm the legitimacy of processes accessing browser data directories. Correlate retrieved process logs with user login sessions and identify any discrepancies. Use EDR tools to trace the source of suspicious API calls. Validate any unknown processes observed accessing memory space of web browsers. Check if the file access coincides with any high-privileged account access or password reset activities. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct a thorough review of system timestamps corresponding to access of browser database files and API invocation. Perform a historical analysis to assess if the activity corresponds with new or irregular logon events. Examine correlated network traffic post-access to identify potential exfills. Validate security patches and browser updates that may have created legitimate behavior resembling TTP activity. Utilize threat intelligence sources to cross-reference indicators with known adversary tactics. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | If a compromise is suspected, isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further data loss. Reset potentially compromised credentials and enforce password changes for impacted accounts. Deploy advanced memory analysis tools to verify unauthorized process memory reads. Engage with incident response teams to evaluate the broader impact and conduct a deep forensic analysis of systems involved. Monitor for any subsequent access attempts using stolen credentials. |
