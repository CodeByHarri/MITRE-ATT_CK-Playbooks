| Name | Credentials from Password Stores: Cloud Secrets Management Stores |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate logs from cloud secret management services such as AWS CloudTrail for AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Cloud Audit Logs for GCP Secret Manager, and Azure Monitor Logs for Azure Key Vault. These logs should specifically focus on API calls related to secret access, such as 'GetSecretValue' for AWS, 'accessSecretVersion' for GCP, and 'SecretGet' for Azure. Additionally, review identity and access management logs to track login events and API requests that involve secret access permissions. |
| Key Indicators | Unusual 'GetSecretValue' commands in AWS, 'gcloud secrets describe' in GCP, and 'az key vault secret show' in Azure executed from unexpected locations or by unusual service accounts. Anomalous patterns in API call volumes requesting secrets. Requests made by accounts that do not typically access secrets. Privilege escalation attempts or changes in permissions shortly before secret requests. |
| Questions for Analysis | Did the request originate from a known and authorized account? Was the request made from an expected geographic location/IP address? Did recent changes occur to the permissions or roles associated with the account? Are there patterns of unusual access times for these requests? Are similar requests frequently made by this user or service? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if requests for secrets are made by accounts not typically associated with these actions, from unusual locations, after recent privilege escalation, or if the requester IP is known for malicious activity. Also, escalate if you detect abnormal volumes of access requests in a short period or any requests from a newly created or modified role or service account. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify the source IP address for legitimacy and past activities. Check if the access attempts coincide with any known legitimate maintenance or deployment activities. Compare logs for sequential login attempts or brute force indicators. Review recent IAM role modifications or unusual assignments leading up to the access. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct a deeper investigation into the access history of the requesting account, including any prior low-volume secret access. Correlate access events with network activities, especially around the time of request. Verify the integrity and configuration of secrets management services and audit any related changes or deployments. Engage with application teams if needed to validate or refute the necessity of these requests. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | If unauthorized access is confirmed, immediately revoke secret access permissions for the suspicious accounts and rotate the exposed secrets. Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of affected systems and accounts to identify further compromise. Strengthen access reviews and enhance monitoring for anomalies in secret management activities. Coordinate with the incident response team to mitigate exposure and inform stakeholders of breach risk and prevention opportunities. |
