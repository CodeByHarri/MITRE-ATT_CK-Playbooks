| Name | Brute Force: Password Cracking |
| Log Sources to Investigate | 1. Authentication logs from Active Directory and other identity systems to detect repeated failed logins or anomalies in access patterns.<br>2. Network traffic logs to spot unusually high data transfers that might indicate credential dumping.<br>3. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) logs to identify unauthorized access to credential storage locations. Examples include event logs (Event ID 4625 for failed logins), Windows Security Event Logs, and network security monitoring tools output. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Multiple failed login attempts from the same source IP address over a short period of time.<br>2. Access attempts to high-value systems/services immediately after a password hash dump event.<br>3. Unexplained spikes in CPU usage or logs indicating password cracking tools execution on systems. 4. Presence of known cracking tools or scripts such as John the Ripper, Cain & Abel, or Hashcat detected via file integrity monitoring systems. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Are the failed login attempts originating from known or unknown IP addresses?<br>2. Is there a pattern or timing to the login attempts that suggest automated activity?<br>3. Do the targeted accounts have administrative privileges, or access to sensitive systems? 4. Are there other indicators of compromise, such as recent OS credential dumping alerts or unusual data extraction activities? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if: 1. There is evidence of successful password cracking attempts with subsequent unauthorized access.<br>2. The source IP for the attempts is external or unexpected for the user/account.<br>3. The attempted accesses target high privilege accounts without plausible justification. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Correlate failed login attempts with user behavior analytics to establish any pattern of compromise.<br>2. Verify timestamps and account usage patterns against known employee activity schedules.<br>3. Assess the user account for recent changes, such as password resets or privilege escalation. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Conduct deep packet analysis of network traffic identified as suspicious.<br>2. Review system and application logs for indicators of password cracking tools or hash dumping activity.<br>3. Corroborate with historical incident data to determine if this activity is part of a broader campaign. 4. Engage with affected user accounts to validate any legitimate access intentions versus suspicious activity. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Isolate affected systems identified as sources or targets of activity for forensic imaging and analysis.<br>2. Reset passwords for impacted accounts and invalidate existing session tokens.<br>3. Enhance monitoring for additional authentication attempts on targeted accounts and systems. 4. Review and improve firewall rules to block further communication from identified malicious IP addresses. |
