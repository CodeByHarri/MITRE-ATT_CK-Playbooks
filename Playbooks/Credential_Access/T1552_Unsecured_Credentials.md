| Name | Unsecured Credentials |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Monitor file access logs for unexpected access to credential-related files such as `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, `.bash_history`, and known application-specific credential repositories. Check system registry access logs indicating interaction with sensitive registry keys that might store credentials. Collect logs from tools like Sysmon for Windows and audit logs for Linux systems to detect suspicious file reads and modifications. Include examples such as tracking access to `.ssh/known_hosts` and `.aws/credentials` files. |
| Key Indicators | High-frequency access to sensitive files that store credentials, especially by non-standard processes or user accounts; Unusual read or write operations to credential storage locations; Alerts triggered by DLP (Data Loss Prevention) systems related to files such as `config.php` or `.bash_history`; Presence of known credential accessing tools in logs, such as Mimikatz on Windows or tools like creddump on Linux. |
| Questions for Analysis | Does the file access pattern match typical user or system behavior? Are there any known instances of the accessing process being exploited in this manner? Is there evidence of lateral movement or further compromise after the access? Are there any associated unexpected modifications to user accounts or permissions? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if the accessed files contain sensitive information and the accessing user or process is unauthorized or has no typical record of such access. Also, escalate if there is evidence suggesting these credentials were used to further compromise the environment, such as lateral movement, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Cross-reference accessed credential files with details of process activity to verify if they belong to legitimate applications. Assess any recent changes in user access rights or installations of new software that might justify the access. Review network logs for signs of outbound connections following the access that could suggest data exfiltration. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct deeper investigation into the provenance of the accessing process and accounts, assessing for indicators of a compromised account or process. Verify integrity and permissions of sensitive directories and files. Use threat intelligence to correlate any access pattern with known adversary TTPs. Consider running a memory capture to identify in-memory credentials or malicious modifications. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Isolate affected systems to prevent further unauthorized access or credential misuse, and reset passwords for potentially compromised accounts. Conduct a thorough review of system logs to identify the point of entry and the presence of any backdoors. Implement enhanced monitoring on other systems for similar suspicious activities and review configurations of all systems to enforce secure storage of credentials. Recommend hardening measures like encrypting sensitive files and enforcing stronger permissions on credential stores. |
