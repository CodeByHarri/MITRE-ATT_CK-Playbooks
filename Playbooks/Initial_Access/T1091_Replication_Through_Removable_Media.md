| Name | Replication Through Removable Media |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate logs from removable media interactions, including autorun settings and execution attempts. Monitor system logs for USB device insertions and driver installations, particularly focusing on logs from Windows Event Viewer such as Event ID 1000 (application execution) and Event IDs related to Removable Storage Access, like 2100 and 2102. Additionally, endpoint detection and response (EDR) logs should be reviewed for suspicious process creations or file modifications involving commonly used directories like Program Files or system directories where autorun could be exploited. |
| Key Indicators | Look for autorun.inf files found on USB media, unusual executable files that mimic legitimate applications, and any unsigned or unexpected application executions initiated from removable media. Identify anomalies such as USB devices frequently connecting to multiple systems without a clear pattern or removable media formatted or rewritten unexpectedly. Any mobile device being detected as a storage device by the system or attempts to execute applications from such devices should be treated as a potential indicator. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Is there an executable file on the removable media with a recent timestamp that seems unusual?<br>2. Does the autorun.inf file attempt to execute a suspicious process?<br>3. Are there unexpected USB device connection logs, indicating possible lateral movement or initial access attempts?<br>4. Has this USB/mobile device been connected to other systems, and is there an execution pattern associated with it?<br>5. Have there been previous security alerts or incidents associated with this user or device? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if there is evidence of executable files running from removable media with unexpected outcomes or without verification of the file's legitimacy. Similarly, escalate if suspicious autorun scripts are detected, or if removable media has been connected to a critical or sensitive system without a prior history of access. If any known indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with malicious removable media use are triggered, escalate immediately. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify the legitimacy of any executable files found on removable media. Check with the user regarding the purpose of the removable media and if the insertion coincides with any suspected unauthorized activity. Correlate media insertions with user activity by reviewing user access logs and timelines. Review historical system modifications or filesystems changes around the time of media insertions. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of the removable media by cloning and scanning it in an isolated environment. Use threat intelligence feeds to check if any hashes of suspicious files match known malicious files. Also, verify autorun configurations at the registry level on compromised systems and perform memory analysis to detect any active malware. Report findings and take appropriate actions, including recommending user awareness training if the activity was non-malicious but careless. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Immediate containment should include disabling autorun features across the organization and informing users of the risks associated with removable media. Remove any malicious autorun entries or executables found on systems or media. Isolate any infected machines from the network to prevent further spread. Conduct a thorough malware sweep and restore systems from a clean backup if necessary. Strengthen monitoring on critical systems and ensure all endpoint protection mechanisms are up to date. |
