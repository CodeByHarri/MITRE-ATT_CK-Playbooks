| Name | Supply Chain Compromise |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate build server logs to check for unauthorized modifications to build scripts or tools. Examine logs from version control systems (e.g., Git, SVN) for unusual commits or branch manipulations. Review update distribution server logs for unauthorized access or anomalies in update packages. Check endpoint protection logs for alerts related to known supply chain threat indicators. Network traffic logs should be analyzed for suspicious communications to known malicious IPs or domains associated with supply chain attacks. |
| Key Indicators | Unrecognized or unauthorized commits in source code repositories. Changes in build scripts or configuration files without proper authorization. Discrepancies in software package hash values against known good versions. Unauthorized access attempts to distribution servers. Unusual patterns in software update or distribution processes. Alerts from endpoint protection systems identifying known malicious supply chain indicators. |
| Questions for Analysis | Were there any unauthorized changes to critical files or configurations in the source code repository? Are there any anomalies in the logs of the distribution network, such as unexpected source IP addresses? Have there been any alerts or detections from security tools regarding modifications to the software supply chain? Are any employees or internal systems showing unusual access patterns to the build or distribution environment? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if there are unauthorized changes to core files, anomalous access patterns are identified in the build environment, detected changes align with known supply chain attack indicators, or if the attack targets high-value assets or systems within the organization. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify recent commits in repositories for legitimacy and appropriateness. Check hash values of recently distributed software against known good versions. Correlate access logs with employee activity to identify potential insider threats. Examine any alerts related to software modifications for additional context. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct deeper forensic analysis on affected systems to identify the scope of compromise. Validate any unauthorized changes in source code by cross-referencing with change requests. Perform threat intelligence analysis to link indicators with known campaigns or adversaries. Collaborate with development and distribution teams to secure the supply chain and patch vulnerabilities. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Isolate affected components from the rest of the network to prevent further compromise. Revert unauthorized changes in the code to the last known good state. Initiate a comprehensive audit of the supply chain process and implement tamper detection mechanisms. Update security measures to include stricter controls and monitoring of supply chain activities. Perform a post-incident review to strengthen security protocols and prevent future occurrences. |
