| Name | Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Side-Loading |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate endpoint logs from EDR solutions for detailed process execution tracking. This includes process creation logs that show parent-child relationships between legitimate applications and unknown DLLs. Check Windows Security Event Logs such as Event ID 4688 (New Process Creation) and Event ID 7045 (Service Installation) to monitor new process executions and service installations. Also, review application logs for discrepancies and any indications of non-standard behaviors. Network logs should be scrutinized for any suspicious outbound traffic resulting after these events. |
| Key Indicators | Look for processes that load DLLs from suspicious directories such as temporary folders or user directories. Identify sudden spikes in applications loading non-standard DLLs. Examine hash mismatches between known legitimate application versions and those appearing in execution logs. Monitor file modifications in program directories that are uncommon or unscheduled. Check for newly created or modified DLLs in unexpected locations, especially if accompanying an otherwise benign executable. |
| Questions for Analysis | Does the legitimate application exhibit unexpected behavior, such as initiating network connections or loading non-standard DLLs? Is there a new or unusual process relationship between known legitimate applications and DLLs from non-standard paths? Are there any anomalies or deviations compared to the application's standard operation or baseline? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if a legitimate application is noted to load DLLs from suspicious directories beyond typical operation or in numbers that surpass threshold norms. Also, escalate if there is evidence of DLLs with no valid digital signature being accessed by high-privilege applications or if unexplained network connections are originating from a potentially side-loaded session. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify the legitimacy of both the parent and child processes by checking file hashes against known lists and analyzing the execution path. Use threat intelligence feeds to match any identified malicious indicators with reported threats. Collect forensic details on loaded DLLs such as path, hash, size, and digital signature status. Note any modifications in operating system files within standard application directories. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct a more comprehensive analysis of suspicious DLLs using reverse engineering tools to detect obfuscation or packed code. Use sandboxing techniques to safely execute and observe behavior. Consult external threat intelligence databases for correlations with known malicious patterns. Evaluate the environment context to determine if similar attack instances are noted across systems, indicating a broader breach. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Quarantine the potentially compromised system to prevent lateral movement. Follow organizational procedures for removing unauthorized DLLs and securely replacing them with verified versions. Conduct a thorough review of adjacent systems for similar TTPs. Lastly, consider a broader investigation into network activities during the time frame of suspected side-loading activities to identify and mitigate additional risks. |
