| Name | Debugger Evasion |
| Log Sources to Investigate | 1. Process Execution Logs: Monitor for suspicious API calls such as IsDebuggerPresent(), NtQueryInformationProcess(), and OutputDebugStringW() invoked by processes.<br>2. Windows Event Logs: Check for application crashes or errors that might indicate debugging activity.<br>3. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry: Look for evidence of process debugging, unexpected detachment, or high frequency of debug-related API calls. 4. Network Logs: Analyze unusual data transmission that might occur as a response to debugger detection. 5. Debugging Tool Logs: Raise alerts if unauthorized debugging tools are executed on endpoints. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Presence of API calls like IsDebuggerPresent() and NtQueryInformationProcess() specifically invoked without known legitimate purposes.<br>2. Frequent or unusual use of OutputDebugStringW().<br>3. High occurrence of exceptions or errors potentially swallowed by debuggers. 4. Rapid changes in malware behavior potentially signaling debugger detection or evasion mechanisms. 5. Unusual absence of malware activity where expected, potentially indicating debugger detection. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Is there evidence of legitimate software development processes that might use debugging APIs frequently?<br>2. Are there known debugging tools installed and integrated with organization processes that might account for this behavior?<br>3. Has there been any recent change or update in software that could explain the debugger-like behavior? 4. Is the affected system known for having developer utilities installed or used by software developers? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if: 1. Debugging-related APIs are called by processes that have no known legitimate use for debugging.<br>2. There is evidence of malware-like behavior altering its state upon detection of debuggers.<br>3. Unexplained or abnormal process terminations or behavior are detected. 4. The executed process is linked to suspicious file signatures or recent threat intelligence. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Verify the originating process and its command line to determine legitimacy.<br>2. Check the user context of the process initiating debugger checks to validate if it aligns with expected activity.<br>3. Correlate with known IDS/IPS alerts for any related suspicious network activity. 4. Review recent file modifications or new files created around the time of event detection. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Conduct a deep dive into process behavior using advanced EDR tools to trace all actions and potential payloads.<br>2. Review historical data across affected and nearby systems for similar patterns or behaviors.<br>3. Cross-reference process with threat intelligence databases for any known indicators of compromise. 4. Analyze network traffic patterns for any associated exfiltration or command and control activity. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Isolate affected systems from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.<br>2. Reverse engineer suspicious payloads where feasible to understand evasion techniques and intentions.<br>3. Monitor closely for any further debugger detection behavior across the enterprise. 4. Apply system hardening techniques to prevent unauthorized debugging activities, including disabling unnecessary developer tools or debugging permissions. 5. Communicate findings with incident response teams to update detection and prevention strategies. |
