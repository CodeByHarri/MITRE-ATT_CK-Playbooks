| Name | Remote Services: Direct Cloud VM Connections |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate logs from cloud provider management consoles such as AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Logs, and GCP Audit Logs. These logs will capture access events and operations on cloud virtual machines. Additionally, security information and event management (SIEM) logs can provide cross-referenced data from potential unauthorized access attempts. For example, logs capturing login attempts with valid accounts to virtual machines and network traffic logs showing unusual connections to these VMs. |
| Key Indicators | Unusual authentication activities such as logins from unexpected geolocations or IP addresses. Use of valid accounts outside of normal business hours or in regions not typical for the organization. Direct console access logs indicating SYSTEM or root-level access, especially if these users do not typically perform such actions. Sudden changes in cloud infrastructure configurations that accompany unexplained access events. |
| Questions for Analysis | Are the logins occurring from known IP addresses or recognized locations? Do the accounts used for access have a legitimate reason to perform direct cloud VM connections? Is there an anomalous time frame or pattern in the access attempts? Are there any sudden configuration changes or VM alterations that coincide with these access logs? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate if there is direct evidence of anomalous login activity unaccounted for by the system's regular behavior profiles, especially from uncommon IP addresses or regions. Escalate if there are multiple failed login attempts followed by a successful connection or if privileged accounts are accessing VMs outside of operational norms. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Perform an initial investigation to match the log events against the expected patterns of behavior for the accounts involved. Correlate IP addresses with known organizational records. Check timestamps for unusual activity patterns, such as access during non-business hours, and verify against any scheduled maintenance or changes. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct a deeper investigation into any suspicious IP addresses to determine their origin and any historical patterns of malicious activity. Review historical logs for any prior unusual access patterns or anomalies that might have been overlooked. Engage with the affected departments to verify whether any legitimate operations were conducted that led to the flagged activity. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Immediate containment measures should include temporarily disabling the suspicious accounts and enforcing password changes. Shut down or isolate affected VMs to prevent further unauthorized access. Engage with cloud service providers for detailed forensic analysis of the accessed instances. Review and enhance security policies to ensure that only necessary and minimal permissions are granted to user accounts for cloud VM access. |
