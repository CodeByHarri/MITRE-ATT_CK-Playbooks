| Name | Compromise Accounts: Email Accounts |
| Log Sources to Investigate | 1. Email server logs to track access patterns and login events, especially from unfamiliar IP addresses.<br>2. Email gateway logs to identify unusual spikes in sent emails or the use of foreign IP addresses.<br>3. Authentication logs from Identity Providers (IdP) to monitor unusual credential usage or failed login attempts. 4. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) logs for alerts related to anomaly detection in user behavior. 5. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution logs on systems commonly used for email access. Examples: Office 365/Exchange Online audit logs, Google Workspace admin logs, and Okta authentication logs. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Sudden increase in outbound email traffic from a specific account.<br>2. Successful login from geographically dispersed locations within a short period (geolocation anomaly).<br>3. Multiple failed login attempts followed by a successful login (indicative of brute force attempts). 4. Access from known malicious IP addresses or anomalous ASN (Autonomous System Number) activity. 5. Creation of email forwarding rules not authorized by the user. 6. Changes in user account settings, such as recovery email or security question alterations. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Is there evidence of multifactor authentication bypass or disablement?<br>2. Have there been any recent password resets or changes for the compromised account?<br>3. Are there any known vulnerabilities in the email service that could have been exploited? 4. Does the compromised account have any privileges or access to sensitive internal or external communications? 5. Are there recurring logins from IP addresses unfamiliar to the legitimate account user? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if: 1. There is confirmation of unauthorized access to sensitive communications.<br>2. The compromised email was used to initiate phishing campaigns targeting internal or external stakeholders.<br>3. Indicators suggest potential lateral movement towards other company assets. 4. The original source of compromise remains unidentified and poses ongoing risk. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Verify and confirm the timing and location of suspicious logins with the legitimate account owner.<br>2. Check if email forwarding or other unauthorized settings modifications have been made.<br>3. Review associated IP addresses for known malicious activity using threat intelligence feeds. 4. Ensure T1 monitors other accounts with similar access patterns to prevent widespread compromise. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Conduct an in-depth investigation into the source IP addresses for potential connections to threat actor infrastructure.<br>2. Analyze email content to identify any indicators of additional compromise or ongoing campaigns.<br>3. Work with IT to conduct a full credential reset and review of MFA configurations. 4. Develop and deploy enhanced monitoring and alerting for the affected and related email accounts. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Immediately disable or reset affected credentials and enforce multifactor authentication.<br>2. Work with legal and compliance teams if PII or sensitive data was involved.<br>3. Perform a post-incident review and strengthen email security policies (e.g., phishing training, enhanced spam filters). 4. Communicate with potentially impacted parties (customers, partners) regarding the compromise and any remediative action taken. |
