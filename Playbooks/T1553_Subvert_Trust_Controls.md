| Name | Subvert Trust Controls |
| Log Sources to Investigate | To investigate this TTP (T1553 - Subvert Trust Controls), analysts should examine several log sources: <br>1. Security Event Logs: Check for any modifications to trust-related settings or attributes indicating software execution. <br>2. File Integrity Monitoring Logs: Review logs for unauthorized changes in file and directory permissions. <br>3. Windows Registry Changes: Monitor registry keys related to trust, including those that manage security warnings for downloaded files. <br>4. Certificate Logs: Look for issuance or installation of new or unusual code signing certificates. <br>5. Application Logs: Investigate logs for execution of applications not typically approved via installed trust mechanisms. |
| Key Indicators | Key indicators of potential trust control subversion include: <br>1. Unexpected permissions changes on system files or directories. <br>2. Unusual registry modifications, especially in trust-related keys. <br>3. Recent installation or use of digital certificates that were not procured through official channels. <br>4. Execution of binaries with invalid or newly recognized code signing certificates. <br>5. User prompts indicating potential trust policy bypass on visiting a website or executing a program. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Are there any logs indicating unauthorized changes to system security configurations?<br>2. Was a new digital certificate installed without verification from trusted sources?<br>3. Is there unusual user activity in relation to trust warnings or security bypass dialogs?<br>4. Are there any recent connections to untrusted sites or execution of untrusted applications? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate if any of the following conditions are met: <br>1. Discovery of new or suspicious code signing certificates lacking verification.<br>2. Unauthorized modifications to file permissions or registry settings affecting trust policies.<br>3. Multiple instances of warnings bypassed by applications unexpectedly.<br>4. Evidence of potentially compromised systems based on certificate or trust system tampering. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Verify if the detected changes in trust controls correspond to any authorized change events or patches.<br>2. Correlate certificate issuance and use with known and approved processes.<br>3. Cross-reference detected suspicious application behavior with current threat intelligence reports.<br>4. Utilize endpoint protection logs to check for alerts relating to trust control breaches. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Deep dive into the timeline of unauthorized changes to understand potential context and scope.<br>2. Analyze the origin of suspicious certificates including source IPs and related network connections.<br>3. Conduct threat hunting activities across systems for similar indicators or scripts.<br>4. Liaise with IT to confirm whether recent legitimate updates might relate to activity detected. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Implement measures to revoke or blacklist suspicious digital certificates.<br>2. Reset to default or secure states for any manipulated trust-related settings.<br>3. Isolate affected systems if compromise is confirmed.<br>4. Conduct a comprehensive audit of certificate issuance processes and policy adherence. <br>5. Ensure incident response procedures include steps specific to trust control infringements and digital certificate compromises. |
