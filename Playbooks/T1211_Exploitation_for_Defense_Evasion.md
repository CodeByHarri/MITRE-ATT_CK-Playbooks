| Name | Exploitation for Defense Evasion |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Focus on logs that capture system interactions and vulnerabilities exploitation attempts. Examples include: System event logs, Application logs (especially those from security software), Cloud service logs (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, GCP Activity Logs), and Network security appliance logs (e.g., IPS/IDS, firewall). Pay special attention to logs indicating failed authentication attempts or system anomalies that might suggest bypass or exploitation. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Unusual patterns of failed authentication followed by a successful attempt.<br>2. Logs of security software being disabled or showing abnormal stoppage.<br>3. Sudden changes in security configurations without authorized administrative actions.<br>4. Indicators of unpatched vulnerabilities being exploited, such as known exploit signatures (CVE references).<br>5. Log entries indicating circumvention of normal security boundaries in SaaS applications.<br>6. Elevated privileges gained unexpectedly.<br>7. Unexpected network traffic destined for high-value assets or security tools. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Is there evidence of security software being targeted or disabled?<br>2. Have there been any recent vulnerability scans revealing exploitable CVEs?<br>3. Are there irregularities in cloud service logins or activities that align with known exploitation techniques?<br>4. Are there any signs of privilege escalation following a suspected exploit?<br>5. Has there been any unsanctioned change to security configurations? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if: 1. There is confirmed exploitation of a vulnerability.<br>2. Security software logs show signs of tampering or disabling attempts.<br>3. There is evidence of privilege escalation related to exploitation activity.<br>4. SaaS log analysis suggests bypassing of security controls or logging mechanisms. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Validate logs for false positives (e.g., expected software updates causing similar logs).<br>2. Correlate logs across multiple sources to identify consistent patterns of exploitation.<br>3. Review recent patches and updates to security software and systems for potential vulnerabilities.<br>4. Assess any anomalous user behavior related to security-sensitive actions. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Conduct in-depth analysis of the vulnerability exploitation route.<br>2. Collaborate with IT/DevOps to compare with known vulnerability advisories (e.g., CVE reports).<br>3. Review detailed historical cloud service logs for patterns consistent with known evasion tactics.<br>4. Develop specific detection rules or signatures to identify similar exploitation attempts in the future. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Isolate affected systems to prevent lateral movement and further exploitation.<br>2. Apply emergency patches or mitigating controls for the exploited vulnerability.<br>3. Coordinate with cloud security teams to implement specific access controls or audit enhancements.<br>4. Gather forensic evidence, including memory and disk analysis of compromised systems.<br>5. Regularly consult with threat intelligence sources to understand broader threat landscape influences. |
