| Name | Gather Victim Host Information: Firmware |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Review system logs, firmware update logs, and network traffic logs. Examples include:<br>- System logs that contain records of firmware queries or commands (e.g., via tools like dmidecode, BIOS/UEFI commands).<br>- Firmware update utilities logs (e.g., Dell Command Update logs, Lenovo System Update logs).<br>- Network traffic logs for anomalous activities related to suspicious external entities attempting to gather firmware information, such as unusual HTTP requests that might relate to system information gathering tools. |
| Key Indicators | Indicators that suggest malicious or unauthorized activities include:<br>- Unusual or unauthorized execution of system information gathering tools (e.g., dmidecode, wmic queries).<br>- Unscheduled or repeated firmware updates detected in logs that do not align with standard IT policies.<br>- Outbound network connections to unfamiliar domains or IPs, especially following firmware information gathering activities. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Are there records of tools or commands being used to gather system firmware information, and what are they?<br>2. Are there any unexplained or unauthorized outbound connections following firmware information requests?<br>3. Does the timing of these activities coincide with known firmware maintenance schedules, or do they occur at irregular hours? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if:<br>- Unauthorized firmware information gathering tools are detected running on critical systems.<br>- Network traffic anomalies related to external domain communication are identified shortly after internal firmware queries.<br>- Thereâ€™s repetitive firmware data gathering from systems without clear justification from IT Documentation. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Verify the legitimacy of the tools or commands recorded in logs against known white-listed applications.<br>2. Check the source and context of outbound connections identified in network logs, including domains/IP reputation checks.<br>3. Correlate detected activities with existing IT change or maintenance records to rule out authorized searches. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Perform a detailed review of the logs associated with targeted systems to ensure complete chain of activity analysis.<br>2. Investigate external network communication anomalies, performing domain/IP intelligence analysis for potential Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).<br>3. Cross-verify with IT teams for any planned activities or externally communicated schedules that could explain anomalies. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Temporarily isolate affected systems to prevent further data leakage if unauthorized access is confirmed.<br>2. Conduct a forensic analysis on systems involved to determine the scope and methods of access/ information gathering.<br>3. Patch any vulnerabilities identified during analysis and review access permissions for all involved systems, ensuring that firmware updates are only applied through trusted channels. |
