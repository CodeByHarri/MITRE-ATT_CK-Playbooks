| Name | Compromise Infrastructure: Web Services |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Monitor logs from web services such as GitHub, Twitter, Dropbox, and Google for unauthorized access attempts. Investigate service access logs for unusual login locations, times, or user-agents. Review any API access logs for unexpected or unauthorized operations. Other log sources include IAM (Identity and Access Management) logs, SIEM alerts about anomalous behaviors, and email logs to catch phishing attempts. Examine DNS logs for uncommon domain resolutions. |
| Key Indicators | Unexpected logins from unusual geolocations or IP addresses. Anomalous access patterns, such as logins at odd hours or from different locations rapidly. Suspicious API key usage indicating unauthorized access. Alerts for password reset requests or suspicious OAuth activity tied to known services. Increased data upload or download activities on suspicious accounts. |
| Questions for Analysis | Is there evidence of logins from unexpected IP addresses or geolocations? Do the log times coincide with times unusual for legitimate use? Are there any patterns showing multiple failed login attempts followed by a successful login? Has there been any recent credential sharing or phishing campaigns targeting our users? Are there new API tokens or unusual OAuth consents granted? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if there are multiple key indicators present, such as unusual login activity combined with invalid login attempts. Escalate if suspicious access is confirmed alongside recent organizational campaigns of phishing. High-volume data transfer detected on compromised accounts should also warrant escalation. Escalate if there is any compromise of a critical service used across the organization. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Correlate user access logs with known geolocations linked to the user's normal activity. Check recent alerts for any IOC (Indicators of Compromise) that might relate to compromised web services. Review MFA usage logs to verify if MFA was bypassed or not prompted during suspicious sessions. Liaise with users to confirm whether they recognize any anomalous access. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct deep dive analysis on suspicious accounts for lateral movement indicators. Review network logs for any unusual data exfiltration patterns correlated with suspicious accounts. Engage with third-party web service providers to obtain more context on the suspicious access activity. Use threat intelligence feeds to identify if the suspicious IPs are known to be associated with past malicious activity. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Initiate account lockout procedures for compromised accounts and perform mandatory password resets. Work with users to enable and enforce stricter MFA policies and procedures. Set up additional monitoring alerts for affected accounts to watch for recurring issues. Forensically analyze any accessed or modified data to assess the extent of information disclosure or tampering. Coordinate with impacted service providers to harden security postures and investigate further access logs. |
