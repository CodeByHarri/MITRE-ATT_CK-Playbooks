| Name | Remote Services: Distributed Component Object Model |
| Log Sources to Investigate | 1. Windows Security Event Logs: Look for events related to DCOM activation, such as Event ID 10016 (DistributedCOM) which indicates permission issues.<br>2. Windows Application Event Logs: Monitor for suspicious COM object activations or errors.<br>3. Network Traffic Logs: Capture traffic that could indicate RPC/DCOM communication between hosts. 4. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Solutions: Check for suspicious process executions related to COM objects. 5. Registry Auditing Logs: Monitor changes to registry keys related to COM object configurations and permissions. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Unexpected DCOM activation logs, especially Event ID 10016, which may indicate unauthorized attempts to activate or access DCOM objects.<br>2. Network traffic to unusual/unauthorized hosts over ports commonly used by RPC/DCOM (e.g., TCP/135).<br>3. Execution of COM objects by non-standard or low-privileged accounts. 4. Changes in registry entries related to COM permissions and configurations, e.g., HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT or HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes. 5. Initiation of processes or applications via DCOM that should not interact over a network. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Was the DCOM access attempt made by a legitimate business process or known application?<br>2. Does the user account associated with the DCOM activity have documented authorization to initiate such connections?<br>3. Is the involved network traffic encrypted, and does it follow expected business patterns? 4. Are there previous instances of similar activity, and were they justified? 5. Is there any correlation between the DCOM activity and other suspicious activities or alerts? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if: 1. The DCOM access involves unauthorized accounts or privileges.<br>2. There is network traffic to unsecured, unexpected, or unauthorized destinations.<br>3. The activity cannot be correlated with legitimate user behavior or business activities. 4. Multiple anomalies are observed in conjunction, such as registry alterations and unauthorized network accesses. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Cross-reference DCOM activation events with known maintenance schedules or software updates.<br>2. Verify user account permissions against organizational policies.<br>3. Check for similar alerts or incidents in historical logs for the same user or machine. 4. Review recent changes to relevant registry entries for unusual modifications. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of the affected systems, checking for signs of exploitation or unauthorized persistence mechanisms.<br>2. Review detailed network traffic captures for signs of data exfiltration or further lateral movement activities.<br>3. Validate any alterations to COM configurations against known exploits and security patches. 4. Liaise with IT teams to confirm any legitimate changes or software deployments. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Isolate affected systems to prevent further potential lateral movement.<br>2. Reset credentials for impacted user accounts if unauthorized access is confirmed.<br>3. Conduct a comprehensive registry audit and revert unauthorized changes to a secure state. 4. Implement additional network segmentation for systems vulnerable to DCOM abuses. 5. Review and apply security patches and configurations to mitigate and prevent further exploitation. |
