| Name | Valid Accounts: Domain Accounts |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate Active Directory logs to review authentication attempts and access patterns, specifically looking for unusual logon events for domain accounts, especially those that occur at odd hours or from atypical geolocations. Also, review Windows Event Logs (Event ID 4624 for successful logons, Event ID 4625 for failed logons), and correlating Kerberos service ticket requests (Event ID 4768). Consider examining exploit prevention tools or EDR logs for suspicious activities related to credential dumping. Network logs can provide additional context, particularly if they reveal connections to known malicious IP addresses or unexplained data exfiltration activities. |
| Key Indicators | Unusual login times or locations for domain accounts, login attempts using accounts with high privileges not consistent with job roles, multiple failed authentication events followed by a successful login, and abnormal requests for access to sensitive systems. Evidence of tools or scripts associated with credential dumping, or privilege escalation methods such as Pass-the-Hash or Pass-the-Ticket attacks. |
| Questions for Analysis | Is the domain account associated with the login attempts consistent with the user's job role and responsibilities? Are there any deviations from the user's normal login patterns, such as time, device, or location? Are there multiple failed login attempts that precede a successful login, possibly suggesting a brute-force attack? Are there any known vulnerabilities associated with the systems involved? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if there are indications of compromised domain accounts with high privileges, evidence of successful credential theft methods (e.g., tools found on the network), or if a user's activity and access appear anomalous or unexplained by legitimate business purposes. Escalate if there is no response from the user when verifying a suspicious login. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Review additional login context, such as source IP addresses and device names, and compare them against expected user behavior. Cross-reference malformed or excessive authentication requests against recent security patches and known vulnerabilities. Verify with users any unusual access or authentication patterns observed and document any justifications provided. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Perform a deep-dive investigation into additional logs not accessed at Tier 1, such as examining Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) for correlated events. Analyze any captured memory or endpoint data for evidence of credential dumping tools. Validate any obtained IP addresses or domains against threat intelligence feeds for information on known threat actors. Correlate findings with recent threat campaigns or specific adversary TTPs. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | If suspicious activity is confirmed, initiate steps to lock or isolate the affected domain accounts immediately and reset all affected passwords. Coordinate with IT to apply all necessary patches or configuration changes to mitigate vulnerabilities. Analyze impacted systems for any signs of lateral movement or persistence mechanisms. Consider performing a forensic investigation on potentially compromised devices to gather more information and assess scope. Implement additional monitoring to detect further unauthorized access attempts. |
