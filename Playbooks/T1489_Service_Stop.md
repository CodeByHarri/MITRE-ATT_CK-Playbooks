| Name | Service Stop |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Examine Windows system event logs for any entries related to service control manager events, specifically Event IDs 7036 (service start and stop) and 7040 (service change configuration). Review security event logs for detailed process tracking (Event ID 4688), focusing on suspicious processes associated with service modification. Investigate application logs related to critical services like MSExchangeIS or SQL Server for abnormalities or interruptions. Network logs can also provide context on remote access to services, potentially indicating adversary activity. |
| Key Indicators | Sudden cessation of critical services such as MSExchangeIS or SQL Server without planned maintenance. Multiple services stopping in rapid succession can also indicate malicious activity. Presence of unauthorized accounts or processes interacting with service management. Correlation of these events with other indicators of compromise such as abnormal account activity or data exfiltration attempts. |
| Questions for Analysis | Were there authorized maintenance activities scheduled during the time of the service stoppage? Is there any correlation between the stopped services and recent patches or updates? Have there been previous service stoppages, and do they align with other known suspicious events or patterns? Are the affected services critical for organization operations? Was there any notification or alert from IT regarding service modifications? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if the stoppage involves critical infrastructure services without a legitimate explanation, is recurring, or if it coincides with other suspicious activities such as unauthorized network connections or file access anomalies. Additionally, escalate if L1 analyst cannot verify the legitimacy of the stoppage with available data or if there's potential impact on critical business operations. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify with IT change management records to check if service stoppage was planned. Check recent emails or communications for any info on scheduled maintenance. Review endpoint protection logs for any detected threats around the time of service stoppage. Analyze user access logs to see if the change was initiated from a known or expected account. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct deeper historical analysis of the affected systems to identify any past irregular service activity patterns. Review any associated alerts or logs from intrusion detection/prevention systems. Coordinate with IT teams to perform integrity checks on affected services and systems. Assess if any known malware or activity correlates with observed behavior (e.g., ransomware campaigns targeting critical services). |
| Containment and Further Analysis | If compromise is suspected, isolate affected systems to prevent further impact. Coordinate with IT teams to restart critical services if safe to do so and implement network segmentations to limit further intrusion. Conduct a forensic investigation to understand the extent and method of compromise. Consider redeploying affected systems from clean backups if needed. Continually monitor for any resurgence of similar activity across the network. |
