| Name | Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Bypass User Account Control |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Monitor security event logs on Windows systems, particularly those related to User Account Control (UAC) events (Event ID 4688 for process creation, Event ID 4624 for successful logons). Check for anomalies or suspicious execution of processes like 'eventvwr.exe' or 'rundll32.exe'. Review application logs for instances of unexpected privilege elevations or COM object activations. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools can also provide alerts on suspicious process trees and behavior patterns associated with UAC bypass attempts. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Execution of known UAC bypass utilities or scripts such as 'eventvwr.exe' executing an unauthorized binary or script.<br>2. Abnormal use of legitimate Windows programs like 'rundll32.exe'.<br>3. Processes that normally do not require elevated privileges running with elevated permissions without user interaction. 4. Use of auto-elevated COM objects in unusual contexts. 5. Presence of known bypass toolkits or scripts (e.g., UACME) on the system. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Was a UAC bypass attempt detected in the logs?<br>2. Is the process involved commonly used on the system, or does it appear out of place?<br>3. Is the user associated with the event known to perform administrative tasks that would normally require privilege elevation? 4. Are there other indicators of compromise or unusual behavior on the system surrounding the time of the UAC bypass event? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if there are multiple instances of UAC bypass attempts from the same user or system, if the process involved is identified as part of known malware or toolkits, or if there are additional indicators of compromise present that suggest a coordinated attack. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Verify whether the detected process is part of legitimate administrative actions.<br>2. Compare the timestamp of the event with any available user activity logs to establish context.<br>3. Check if similar events have occurred on other systems or users to identify a potential pattern. 4. Search for any scripts or tools on the system that may indicate the method of UAC bypass. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the affected system, checking for known malicious indicators associated with UAC bypass.<br>2. Analyze network traffic for potential data exfiltration or lateral movement activity.<br>3. Validate the legitimacy of the COM objects or DLLs loaded through 'rundll32.exe'. 4. Gather memory dumps or other system artifacts for further investigation. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further unauthorized access.<br>2. Remove or quarantine any discovered malware or unauthorized scripts.<br>3. Review and adjust Group Policy settings to enforce a higher UAC security level where feasible. 4. Conduct post-incident review and lessons learned analysis to update detection capabilities and user awareness training regarding UAC prompts and security best practices. |
