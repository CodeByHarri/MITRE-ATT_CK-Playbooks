| Name | Data Manipulation: Runtime Data Manipulation |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Monitor application logs for unexpected or unauthorized changes, particularly those related to display functions or data visualization components. Review system logs for signs of unauthorized access or changes to binary files. Network logs should be analyzed for unusual data flows that may indicate data manipulation in transit. Endpoint detection systems (EDRs) like Carbon Black or CrowdStrike can provide insights into process executions and changes. File integrity monitoring (FIM) solutions should be reviewed for unauthorized modifications to application binaries. |
| Key Indicators | Sudden changes in application behavior or displayed data without corresponding legitimate updates. Alert from file integrity monitoring systems showing unauthorized alterations to application binaries. Anomalous process creation and suppression or unusual execution patterns that do not align with normal operations. Abnormal network traffic patterns possibly exfiltrating or manipulating critical data used in business processes. |
| Questions for Analysis | Has there been any recent update or patching activity that might explain changes in application behavior? Are there any unauthorized or suspicious user accounts showing access to critical systems or application binaries? Do the observed changes correlate with any known threat actor TTPs or recent adversarial campaigns? Is there corroborating evidence from multiple sources that suggests malicious activity? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate if unauthorized changes to application binaries are detected without legitimate explanation. Escalate if there is evidence of masquerading techniques aiming to disguise a process to appear legitimate. Escalate if data integrity issues are observed in key business process applications that could impact organizational decision-making. If the initial analysis is inconclusive but suspicious patterns are confirmed, escalation is warranted. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify whether recent legitimate updates or maintenance activities could explain the changes. Investigate any alerts of unauthorized system access around the time of identified data manipulations. Cross-reference user activity and access logs with the timing of the anomalies. Check for alerts or anomalies in network traffic around the time of the suspected manipulation. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct deeper investigation into identified anomalies in logs and network traffic. Review any specialized software tools linked with the manipulated system to identify abuse or misuse. Perform a detailed forensic analysis on any identified suspicious binaries or processes. Consult with development or engineering teams to understand potential impacts on business operations and data integrity. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Isolate affected systems to prevent further manipulation or data loss. Conduct a detailed forensic review to understand the extent of data manipulation and potential vulnerabilities exploited. Restore systems to the last known good state using backup and recovery protocols. Engage relevant stakeholders to assess business process impact and coordinate recovery efforts. |
