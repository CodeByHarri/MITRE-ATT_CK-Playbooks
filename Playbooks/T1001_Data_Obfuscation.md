| Name | Data Obfuscation |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Network traffic logs (e.g., NetFlow, PCAPs) to identify unusual patterns or obfuscation in data flows. Proxy logs to track any unusual behavior towards external domains. Firewall logs for unauthorized or abnormal port/protocol usage. IDS/IPS logs to detect evasion techniques. DNS logs to identify potentially suspicious domain lookups associated with C2 traffic. Endpoint logs, such as those from EDR solutions, which might capture anomalous application behaviors or communications. |
| Key Indicators | Unusual or high entropy in network traffic that suggests encrypted or obfuscated data. Network connections that use non-standard ports or frequently change destinations. Protocols behaving in unexpected ways, such as HTTP traffic without legitimate headers or payloads. Presence of steganography markers in bandwidth usage or file transfers. Communication patterns that mimic legitimate protocols but exhibit off-kilter timing or sequencing. |
| Questions for Analysis | Is there a pattern of network activity that deviates from typical baseline behavior? Are there instances of unusual port usage or protocols that don't align with business operations? Can we see any established connections to known suspicious or untrusted domains? Are there communication attempts with unusual metadata or lacking the expected structure of common protocols? Do endpoint logs show applications behaving differently than normal timelines or engaging in uncommon data exchanges? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if obfuscated or encrypted network traffic is confirmed, especially if connecting to non-whitelisted IPs or domains. Escalate if signature-based detection tools flag the traffic as potentially malicious or when significant deviations from normal traffic baselines are identified. Evidence of communications using unusual or multiple encryption layers without legitimate justification should be escalated. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Review network traffic baseline profiles to identify deviations. Cross-reference identified suspicious traffic with threat intelligence databases for indicators of compromise (IOCs). Analyze metadata of suspicious packets for oddities in headers, lengths, or protocols. Collect additional endpoint logs around the times of suspicious activity to look for possible correlating behaviors or anomalies. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Perform deep packet inspection to better understand the content and structure of suspect network communications. Use threat intelligence to correlate the IPs or domain names involved with known threats or recent attack reports. Emphasize identifying methods of obfuscation used and validate against known evasion tactics. Consider setting up a controlled environment to reproduce and study the behavior of the identified traffic. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Block identified suspicious IP addresses or domains at the firewall. Implement rate limiting or blackhole procedures if patterns suggest DDoS-like traffic obfuscations. Use network segmentation to isolate affected systems. Ensure data retention policies allow for in-depth packet capture and analysis post-incident. Coordinate with IT and security teams to apply any necessary patches or updates to vulnerable systems. Post-incident, review and update network monitoring rules/policies to better catch similar future activities. |
