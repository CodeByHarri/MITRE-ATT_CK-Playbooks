| Name | Impair Defenses: Disable Windows Event Logging |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Monitor Windows Event Logs, specifically the Security, System, and Application logs, to detect any disruptions. Check for changes to the 'EventLog' service status using PowerShell or service control manager executables, such as 'Set-Service', 'sc config', or registry modifications in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. Inspect logs for 'auditpol' command usage which indicates modifications to audit policies. Example logs: Security logs (Event ID 1100: Audit log cleared), System logs (Event ID 7040: Service start type has changed), and PowerShell logs for command execution. |
| Key Indicators | Suspicious service control commands targeting EventLog (e.g., 'Set-Service -Name EventLog', 'sc config eventlog start=disabled'), registry key changes affecting EventLog start-up type, audit policy alterations using 'auditpol', unusual system reboots soon after registry key modifications. Detection of 'auditpol /clear' or 'auditpol /remove' commands in logs. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Were there any legitimate administrative tasks scheduled that could cause the event log or audit policy changes?<br>2. Did the user executing the commands have previous history of such actions?<br>3. Are there any known system updates or software installations that justify these actions? 4. Is there any correlation with other suspicious activities in the environment, such as unexpected system reboots or access anomalies? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if: Unexplained modification of audit policy or event log settings by non-admin users is detected. Multiple systems exhibit similar suspicious activities. The changes coincide with other indicators of potential compromise, such as execution of malware. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Review Windows event logs for user account associated with the changes. Check for recent PowerShell activities and commands that align with disabling event logging. Correlate with endpoint protection alerts for any anomalies correlating to the timeframe of the detected changes. Verify system startup logs for unscheduled reboots after registry modifications. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Perform a deeper forensic analysis of systems showing signs of event log or audit policy tampering. Leverage EDR tools to check for indicators of compromise related to event disabler TTPs. Analyze historical logs to identify recurring patterns or associations with known threat actor TTPs. Scrutinize any remote access attempts around the time of detected actions. Confirm if persistence techniques were employed post modifications. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Immediately block network and administrator access to affected systems. Restore event logging and audit policy configurations to baseline settings. Initiate a full malware scan to identify potential malicious payloads. Analyze system memory and network activity for traces of exploit traffic or attempts. Work with IT to ensure security patches are current and any exposed vulnerabilities are mitigated. Communicate findings and risk assessments to security leadership and impacted teams. |
