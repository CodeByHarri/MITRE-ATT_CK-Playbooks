| Name | Stage Capabilities: Upload Tool |
| Log Sources to Investigate | To investigate the staging of tools on third-party infrastructure, security logs from web servers, DNS logs, firewall logs, and proxy logs should be analyzed. Web server access logs can reveal if tools have been uploaded or accessed. DNS and proxy logs can indicate connections to suspicious or previously unknown domains, especially if these are registered to external hosting services like GitHub or cloud providers. Firewall logs may reveal unauthorized uploads or downloads to/from known malicious IPs. |
| Key Indicators | Look for unusual uploads on web servers, especially to directories not typically used for storing executable files. Monitor for HTTP/HTTPS requests to IPs or domains associated with new or unknown services. Check for connections to cloud services like GitHub, AWS, Azure, or Heroku where the organization doesn't usually operate. Another key indicator is repeated access to staging areas or tool directories from external IPs. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Is there evidence of tools being uploaded to web directories that are normally unused?<br>2. Are there any unknown external domains or IPs accessing the tools?<br>3. Is the source domain or IP associated with known cloud service providers or open-source repositories? 4. Are there logs indicating the tools were accessed multiple times or from unexpected geographic regions? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalation to Tier 2 is needed if: 1. Tools were verified as being uploaded or accessed from external sources that are not part of the organization's operations.<br>2. There is evidence of anomalous patterns in the access logs, such as unusual time of day or frequency.<br>3. The source or destination IPs are linked to known threat actors or previously identified malicious activity. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Confirm the hash values of uploaded files against known tool signatures or malware databases.<br>2. Verify the domains/IPs making requests to web servers against threat intelligence databases.<br>3. Establish a timeline of when the uploads occurred and compare against normal operation hours. 4. Look for corroborating evidence in endpoint logs or for additional network activity that could indicate a broader attack. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Conduct deeper analysis using threat intelligence tools to verify the legitimacy of domains/IPs.<br>2. Correlate findings with other suspicious activities or indicators from different logs (e.g., security events from endpoints, anomalous user behavior).<br>3. Coordinate with IT teams to determine if the accessed tools were legitimate uploads by authorized users or processes and validate any purpose behind these uploads with the responsible departments. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Block all identified malicious IPs or domains at the firewall level.<br>2. Quarantine any suspicious files for further forensic analysis.<br>3. Use sandboxing to understand the behavior of suspicious tools. 4. Implement tighter access controls on web servers, including multi-factor authentication and in-depth monitoring, to prevent unauthorized uploads. 5. Consider reaching out to third-party services (e.g., GitHub) to take down adversary-controlled repositories if applicable. |
