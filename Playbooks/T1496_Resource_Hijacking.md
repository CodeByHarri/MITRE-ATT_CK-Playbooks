| Name | Resource Hijacking |
| Log Sources to Investigate | To investigate Resource Hijacking, the following log sources should be prioritized: <br>- System Performance Logs: Monitor for unusual CPU/GPU usage patterns, which may indicate cryptocurrency mining. <br>- Network Traffic Logs: Identify abnormal outbound connections or traffic patterns that could suggest bandwidth selling or proxy network activities. <br>- Cloud Service Logs: Investigate unusual spikes in cloud-based service usage, such as email or messaging services, which may indicate abuse for spam activities. <br>- SMS Gateway Logs: Check for unexpected volumes of SMS traffic, which could suggest SMS generation for profit. <br>Examples of log sources include AWS CloudWatch, sysmon for local system monitoring, and network flow logs from firewalls and routers. |
| Key Indicators | Key indicators of Resource Hijacking include: <br>- Sudden and sustained increases in CPU/GPU/RAM usage. <br>- Outbound network traffic to known cryptomining pools or unusual IP addresses. <br>- Significant and unexplained increases in cloud resource consumption, like EC2 or messaging service usage. <br>- Large volumes of outbound SMS or email traffic without a corresponding business case. <br>- Abnormal billing alerts or unexpected cloud cost spikes. |
| Questions for Analysis | When reviewing potential Resource Hijacking, Tier 1 analysts should consider the following: <br>- Is there an unexplained increase in system resource utilization? <br>- Are there new or unexpected outbound network connections that need further investigation? <br>- Is there any unauthorized use of cloud services or unexpected service charges? <br>- Has the organization recently experienced any billing discrepancies or alerts from cloud providers? <br>- Are systems exhibiting any unusual or suspicious exception logs or performance alerts? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 when: <br>- Resource usage patterns are consistent with heavily resource-intensive activities that are not aligned with legitimate business operations. <br>- Outbound traffic indicates potential connections to known malicious IP addresses or cryptomining pools. <br>- Cloud cost spikes have no valid business justification or lead to potential budget impacts. <br>- On-hand analysis tools are insufficient to validate the legitimacy of the activity. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Tier 1 analysts can perform the following additional steps: <br>- Validate high resource utilization through other internal dashboards or monitoring tools to confirm it is not a reporting error. <br>- Trace network traffic patterns to identify endpoints involved in potential cryptomining or proxying activities. <br>- Confirm the legitimacy of outbound SMS or email traffic with the associated business units. <br>- Check for any newly installed software or processes that could be linked to resource hijacking activities. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Tier 2 analysts should: <br>- Conduct a deeper analysis of traffic logs to trace activities to specific users or processes. <br>- Utilize threat intelligence platforms to match IP addresses and hash values associated with the suspicious activity against known cyber threats. <br>- Engage with cloud service providers to verify any anomalies or inconsistencies in service usage or billing. <br>- Collaborate with IT to review the configurations or patches of affected systems as needed. <br>- Report findings to cybersecurity stakeholders emphasizing potential impacts on system performance and business operations. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Containment steps include: <br>- Isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further resource hijacking. <br>- Revoke access to any compromised cloud accounts or adjust IAM policies to reduce risk exposure. <br>- Increase resource allocation management policies to detect and alert on future abnormal use early. <br>Further analysis should focus on: <br>- Performing a detailed forensic investigation of affected systems to identify root cause and entry points. <br>- Reviewing all related network traffic logs for additional indicators of compromise. <br>- Implementing advanced monitoring solutions and enhancing alerting thresholds for resource usage anomalies. |
