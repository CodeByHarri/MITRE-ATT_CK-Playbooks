| Log Sources to Investigate | Collect and review security logs from the following sources: Windows Security Event Logs (look for Event ID 4624 for successful logons and Event ID 4625 for failed logons, particularly those with anomalous logon types such as Type 3 or Type 10 that are not typical for the identified user or session time), Kerberos authentication logs (analyze Event ID 4768 and Event ID 4769 for anomalies tied to service ticket requests or unusual account usage), Network Traffic Analysis Logs (monitor for abnormal SMB or RPC traffic patterns indicating lateral movement attempts), Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) logs for any suspicious process executions like 'mimikatz' that are often used to extract hashes). |
| Key Indicators | Presence of anomalies in logon patterns for specific users (e.g., logons from unexpected IP addresses or locations for known users, unusual logon types such as Type 3 or 10), Detection of successful logons with NTLM hashes instead of passwords, High volume of authentication requests using the same hash, Unusual process execution linked to credential dumping tools (e.g., mimikatz), Network traffic spikes referencing SMB/RPC that are atypical for the originating user, Kerberos service ticket anomalies like old or manipulated tickets. |
| Questions for Analysis | Is there evidence of anomalous logon activity for the user in question? Are there any unusual logon locations or IPs? Is there a sudden increase in authentication attempts that deviate from normal patterns for the user account? Was there a known credential dumping attempt prior to spotting the unusual activity? Are logons frequently being made with NTLM, and is that consistent with the organization's normal operations? Are there other correlating anomalies such as unexpected Kerberos ticket requests? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if there is unusual or excessive successful NTLM authentication detected without corresponding cleartext password attempts, particularly if accompanying network traffic analysis suggests lateral movement. Also escalate if there are concurrent anomalies in Kerberos ticketing patterns or anomalous process execution tied to credential dumping. Further, elevate cases with indications of successful unauthorized access to sensitive environments. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Run scripts or tools that validate the legitimacy of suspicious authentication attempts (e.g., check the timestamp, source, and correlation with known user activity), Cross-reference with other security tools to identify potential false positives, Verify whether there has been any recent password changes or security alerts related to the suspected accounts, Contextualize with time, source, and application access history available in SIEM. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Perform a deeper inspection of process trees on affected endpoints to identify and verify the execution of any credential extraction methods, Engage in active directory analysis to detect potential hash dumping activities and verify the strength and anomalies within recent authentication tickets, Corroborate with threat intelligence for similar tactics and indicators used by known adversaries, Validate log integrity and search for potential log tampering or gaps. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Immediately isolate systems which exhibit confirmed unauthorized PtH attacks to prevent further compromise, Reset passwords and invalidate tokens for affected user accounts, Enforce stricter network segmentation and authentication controls to limit further lateral movement, Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to identify the initial breach and assess its extent, Strengthen endpoint defenses including implementing enhanced logging and real-time monitoring for hash-passing activities, Consider deploying multi-factor authentication for critical assets and users to mitigate similar future risks. |
