| Name | Inter-Process Communication: XPC Services |
| Log Sources to Investigate | 1. macOS System Logs: Check logs under /var/log/ for suspicious XPC service activity or logs in Console.app.<br>2. Application Logs: Review application-specific logs that leverage XPC for inter-process communication.<br>3. Security Logs: Look for entries regarding privilege escalation attempts or unauthorized code execution. 4. File Integrity Monitoring Logs: Monitor critical system files and directories for unauthorized changes or unexpected access often linked to malicious XPC service activity. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Unusual XPC connection requests originating from non-standard applications.<br>2. Failed or repeating XPC connection attempts to privileged XPC services.<br>3. Error logs indicating malformed XPC messages or protocol definition discrepancies. 4. Unexpected use of NSXPCConnection API in applications not previously observed utilizing it. 5. Corresponding spikes in network activity or other anomalous behavior immediately following XPC-related alerts. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Is there a known legitimate use of XPC services by the application triggering the alert?<br>2. Have there been recent changes or updates to the application or system that could explain the activity?<br>3. Are there any associated indicators or alerts, such as attempts for privilege escalation or unauthorized access? 4. Is the activity consistent with any known attack patterns or signatures? |
| Decision for Escalation | 1. Escalate if malicious or unauthorized use of XPC services is confirmed, especially if linked to privilege escalation.<br>2. Escalate if the XPC activity is associated with additional indicators of compromise (IOCs).<br>3. Escalate if the activity cannot be explained by normal application behavior and poses a potential threat. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Validate the alert by cross-referencing logs and indicators to confirm suspicious activity.<br>2. Identify all processes involved in the XPC service communication and their hierarchy.<br>3. Check recent system and application updates or configuration changes. 4. Access incident response knowledge base for any documented similar cases or signatures. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Perform in-depth analysis of suspicious XPC communication, including protocol verification.<br>2. Use dynamic analysis or sandbox testing to assess behavior and intent of involved applications.<br>3. Correlate XPC communication logs with other system and network activity for broader attack context. 4. Update detection rules and profiles to improve detection accuracy against XPC abuse. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Temporarily block the application responsible for malicious XPC activity and isolate affected systems.<br>2. Download and preserve full logs for incident reporting and legal purposes.<br>3. Conduct a thorough investigation to determine if unauthorized access or data exfiltration occurred. 4. Apply security patches or configuration hardening measures recommended by security advisories. |
