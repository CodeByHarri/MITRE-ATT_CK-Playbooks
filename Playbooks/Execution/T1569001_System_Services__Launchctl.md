| Name | System Services: Launchctl |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate system logs and security logs on macOS devices. Specifically, look into logs related to launchctl and launchd activities. Use Console or syslog to access system logs that can reveal launchctl command executions. Examples include: /var/log/system.log, /var/log/asl/*. Search for entries with 'launchctl load', 'launchctl start', or 'launchctl unload'. Also, review Unified Logs via the log command line utility to search for specific launchctl usage. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Occurrence of 'launchctl load -w' or '/bin/launchctl load' commands in the system logs.<br>2. Abnormal or unexpected entries in the /Library/LaunchAgents or /Library/LaunchDaemons directories.<br>3. Execution of uncommon or suspicious applications via launchctl. 4. Creation or modification of plist files concerning Launch Agents or Daemons that aren't typical for their respective systems. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Is the system used by an individual or role that frequently interacts with system services?<br>2. Do the launchctl commands correlate with any legitimate software installations or updates?<br>3. Is the path or executable associated with launchctl commands legitimate or typical for this environment? 4. Are there any known bad behaviors or hashes tied to executables involved in the launchctl command? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if: 1. Suspicious or unexpected Launch Agents/Daemons are identified.<br>2. There is no legitimate or documented purpose for the identified launchctl actions.<br>3. Historical behaviors of the user or system do not support the identified launchctl activities. 4. The involved executables are recognized as part of known malware or are unsigned/unverified software. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Verify if there is a change in the configuration or new installations that justify the use of launchctl.<br>2. Identify any recent software updates or installations that may explain the entries.<br>3. Compare the suspicious event time to other concurrent logs for potential intrusion indicators. 4. Check user account activity logs around the time of the launchctl events for any anomalies. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Conduct a deeper examination of the plist files associated with the suspicious launchctl activities.<br>2. Utilize threat intelligence databases to check if any of the binaries involved match known threats.<br>3. Analyze related network traffic for any signs of C2 communications if launchctl activities correlate with potential malware. 4. Conduct root cause analysis to ascertain the method of introduction if malicious activity is confirmed. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further potential malicious network activity.<br>2. Remove or disable confirmed malicious Launch Agents or Daemons.<br>3. Conduct a full malware scan and forensic analysis to comprehend the full scope of compromise. 4. Apply operating system and application patches to close potential vulnerabilities used by the adversaries. |
