| Name | Network Denial of Service: Reflection Amplification |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Network traffic logs, specifically netflow or packet capture data, should be scrutinized for unusual and high-volume traffic patterns. Firewall and intrusion detection/prevention system (IDPS) logs can provide insights into blocked or flagged malicious traffic. Logs from network devices such as routers and switches can help identify traffic patterns indicative of reflection amplification attacks. Additionally, application logs from DNS, NTP, and memcache servers should be checked for abnormal request volumes or rates, especially from unexpected sources. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Unusual spikes in inbound traffic towards a single or multiple network assets, primarily using UDP protocol.<br>2. Traffic patterns showing a high number of requests to known reflection amplification services such as DNS, NTP, or memcache servers.<br>3. Source IP addresses of traffic may be obfuscated or show signs of IP spoofing. 4. Anomalous traffic volumes disproportionately larger than typical request sizes, suggesting amplification. 5. Multiple requests sent to external hosts with the spoofed IP address of the target. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Are there identifiable patterns or signatures of high-volume traffic tied to known reflection amplification protocols (DNS, NTP, memcache, etc.)?<br>2. Does the source IP appear to be spoofed?<br>3. Have there been any similar spikes in traffic towards the same target in recent history? 4. Is there a legitimate business reason for such high volumes of traffic based on operational context? 5. Are there external reports of ongoing reflection amplification attacks using the same services observed? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if initial investigations confirm unusual volume spikes from reflection amplification vectors, especially if traffic patterns match known attack methodologies. Escalation is also required if traffic affects business operations or if there's evidence of IP spoofing. Additionally, escalate if such patterns have been reported in external threat intelligence feeds. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Verify the attack vectors (DNS/NTP/memcache) involved in the traffic spike.<br>2. Determine potential amplification factors by comparing inbound vs. outbound traffic ratios.<br>3. Validate whether the source IPs are possibly spoofed using geo-location or known network ranges. 4. Check with operational departments for any scheduled activities that might explain the traffic spike. 5. Generate and gather performance metrics from affected services for a baseline comparison. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Perform a deeper analysis of packet captures to confirm spoofing and reflection behavior.<br>2. Correlate incoming logs with threat intelligence sources for known indicators of a coordinated attack.<br>3. Engage with service providers or reflector service hosts to validate if they are hosting traffic generators. 4. Apply baseline and anomaly detection methods to corroborate the attack claim. 5. Prepare incident reports and assess potential operational impacts with mitigation recommendations. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Implement immediate network security measures such as advanced rate-limitings or ACLs to mitigate ongoing attack traffic.<br>2. Collaborate with upstream providers to block or redirect malicious traffic.<br>3. Conduct a forensic analysis on the affected network segment to identify exploitation paths or vulnerabilities leveraged. 4. Audit and secure reflector servers or services (DNS, NTP, memcache) internally or externally to prevent misuse. 5. Review and enhance detection rules in intrusion detection systems towards better pavilion of future attacks. |
