| Log Sources to Investigate | To investigate T1048.003, monitor network traffic through packet capture tools like Wireshark or Zeek, and check firewall logs, proxy logs, and DNS logs. Examples of relevant logs include HTTP access logs, FTP transfer logs, and DNS query logs, focusing on unusual data patterns or unexpectedly large data transfers over non-standard ports. Reviewing logs from intranet servers and data repositories for unexpected export or query operations may also be useful. |
| Key Indicators | Look for abnormal network traffic on unencrypted protocols such as HTTP, FTP, and DNS that show signs of obfuscation like base64 encoding in headers or request data. Large volume data transfers to external IP addresses that are not typical destinations, data sent outside usual business hours, and repeated attempts to access restricted domains or IPs are key indicators. Examine unusual spikes in DNS queries that may hint at data exfiltration via DNS tunneling. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Is the source IP associated with known internal assets or outside threat actors?<br>2. Does the destination IP/domain correspond to usual business partners?<br>3. Are there signs of obfuscation like base64 encoding in the data payloads or headers? 4. Does the activity correlate with any recent changes in the system or network that could justify the data exchange? 5. Are there similar patterns of activity observed from other assets within the network? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if the source or destination of the network traffic cannot be corroborated as legitimate, if obfuscation tactics are confirmed, or if attempts are ongoing. If sensitive data is involved or regulatory compliance risks are identified, this should also trigger escalation. A repeated pattern of such activities across multiple assets should be treated with higher urgency. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Examine the metadata of the transferred data to determine if it contains sensitive information.<br>2. Review historical logs for similar traffic patterns from the identified asset.<br>3. Validate whether there are legitimate business reasons for the communication with the identified external IP or domain. 4. Use threat intelligence databases to check if the destination IPs or domains are associated with past suspicious activities. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Scrutinize deep packet inspection data to assess payload contents and confirm obfuscation or data leakage.<br>2. Correlate any found indicators with threat intelligence platforms to identify known malicious IPs or domains.<br>3. Engage with system and network administrators to verify the legitimacy of the traffic and validate recent system changes that might justify the activity. 4. Explore logs from endpoint protection tools for signs of compromise or data staging activity. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Block outbound traffic to the suspicious destination using firewall rules or network filter software.<br>2. Quarantine affected systems or network segments to prevent further data exfiltration.<br>3. Audit and update security policies related to data transfer to ensure tighter controls on data egress points. 4. Perform a comprehensive forensic analysis of the affected systems, looking specifically for data staging directories or scripts used for obfuscation. 5. Notify data protection and compliance teams for assessment and regulatory reporting if necessary. |
