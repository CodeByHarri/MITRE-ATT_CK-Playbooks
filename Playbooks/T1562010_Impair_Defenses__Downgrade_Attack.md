| Name | Impair Defenses: Downgrade Attack |
| Log Sources to Investigate | 1. PowerShell execution logs - Look for invocations of older versions of PowerShell (e.g., versions <5) using Windows Event IDs 4104 (Script block logging) if available or 4688 for process creation.<br>2. Network traffic logs - Analyze proxy, firewall logs, and IDS/IPS logs for signs of protocol downgrading, particularly HTTPS to HTTP.<br>3. Application logs - Check for compatibility settings changing logs or logs related to software version usage. 4. System Security and Application logs - Audit backward compatibility usage settings if configured. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Execution of PowerShell scripts using old versions without Script Block Logging.<br>2. Unauthorized modifications to application compatibility settings.<br>3. Network traffic patterns indicating protocol downgrade, such as HTTP traffic on traditionally secured sites. 4. Indicators of Adversary-in-the-Middle or network sniffing activity indicating possible exploitation attempts. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Is there a legitimate business justification for using an older version of PowerShell or application features?<br>2. Were any maintenance activities scheduled that could explain the protocol downgrade?<br>3. Are there any corroborating alerts or logs that indicate this activity might be part of a legitimate process? 4. Has the device or user previously displayed suspicious activity, such as frequent attempts to access secured data without authorization? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if: 1. There is no legitimate business justification for using downgraded or older application versions.<br>2. The activity is concurrent with other malicious indicators (e.g., malware alerts, unauthorized data access attempts).<br>3. There are inconsistencies in user or device activity that align with known TTPs of downgrade attacks. 4. Decrypted network traffic contains sensitive information that should be protected. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Review recent changes in the security configurations of impacted systems to find the origin of the downgrade.<br>2. Correlate logs to determine the timing and duration of the activity.<br>3. Check user permissions and group membership of the involved accounts to ensure they align with expected roles and privileges. 4. Confirm the presence of any anomalies in proxy logs related to HTTPS to HTTP conversion attempts. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Conduct deeper forensic analysis on system and network logs to trace the downgrade activity.<br>2. Examine whether this activity is part of a larger attack pattern using temporal and spatial analysis.<br>3. Validate sources of older versions to identify potential exploitation opportunities or sources of compromised software. 4. Collaborate with network teams to verify the integrity of secure connection settings and address potential vulnerabilities. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Temporarily isolate affected systems to prevent further exploitation and data exposure.<br>2. Revert any unintended compatibility settings and enforce strict application version policies.<br>3. Implement mitigation measures including updating affected systems and firewall rules to block downgraded protocol attempts. 4. Provide detailed reporting to incident response teams with recommendations for securing backward compatibility features. 5. Conduct post-incident analysis to improve detection capabilities for downgrade attack tactics. |
