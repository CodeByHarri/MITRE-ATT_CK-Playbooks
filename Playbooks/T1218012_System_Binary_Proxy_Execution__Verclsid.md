| Name | System Binary Proxy Execution: Verclsid |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate security event logs, specifically Windows Security Logs and Sysmon logs, for any activity involving 'verclsid.exe'. Pay attention to command-line arguments associated with 'verclsid.exe' executions. Additionally, review application logs, event logs, and EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) alerts for signs of suspicious COM object activity associated with CLSID execution. Network activity logs should be examined for indications of outbound connections to potentially malicious remote servers, particularly if there is evidence of SCT (Script Component Technology) files being accessed. |
| Key Indicators | Anomalous execution of 'verclsid.exe' with parameters '/S /C {CLSID}'. Unusual patterns such as execution of 'verclsid.exe' from unexpected directories or with non-standard parameters. Network connections made by 'verclsid.exe', especially if connecting to atypical or known malicious IP addresses or domains. Presence of unexpected or unauthorized COM scriptlets being loaded and executed. Alerts from application control solutions or antivirus regarding suspicious activities directly following 'verclsid.exe' execution. |
| Questions for Analysis | Is 'verclsid.exe' being executed with unusual parameters or in contexts that are not typical for normal system operations? Is the source of the execution traceable to a legitimate software operation or is it occurring in an environment where it wouldn't be expected? Are there associated indicators of compromise like network connections to known malicious IPs or domains? Is there evidence of attempted persistence mechanisms besides the immediate execution activity? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate if 'verclsid.exe' is found executing with suspicious CLSID parameters not typical for regular usage, or if it links to known threat actors or malicious IP addresses. Escalate immediately if there is evidence of successful network communication to malicious hosts or download of additional malicious payloads. Likewise, escalate if this activity is accompanied by alerts of other suspicious activities such as unauthorized file modifications or the presence of new persistence mechanisms. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Collect and analyze full command-line context for the execution of 'verclsid.exe'. Review execution logs and correlate with network activity to identify any anomalous connections or downloads initiated using 'verclsid.exe'. Perform initial checks for host integrity and any unauthorized modifications to critical system files or settings. Document any deviations or anomalies from expected system behavior. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Perform deeper analysis of the potentially malicious CLSID referenced by 'verclsid.exe'. Use sandbox analysis or code analysis tools to evaluate any scriptlets or payloads potentially executed. Investigate the context of any downloaded files or network connections to determine if they are linked to known threat actors or campaigns. Cross-check with threat intelligence sources to corroborate findings. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Immediately isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further outbound connections or download of malicious content. Remove or disable the malicious COM object or scriptlet associated with the activity. Further forensic investigation on isolated systems should be conducted to understand the initial infection vector and scope of compromise. Apply patches or updates if this vector is linked to any existing vulnerabilities. Consider strengthening application whitelisting or control solutions to more effectively monitor and block potential misuse of legitimate system binaries. |
