| Name | Gather Victim Host Information: Client Configurations |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Review web server logs, particularly focusing on incoming requests for unusual or suspicious user agent strings that could indicate probing or automatic collection (e.g., non-browser user agents). Check for logs from network intrusion detection systems for any scanning activities that identify client configurations. Also, examine proxy logs for abnormal traffic patterns or repeated requests to resources that could reveal client details. If available, correlate data from endpoint detection systems for any unauthorized data access events or unusual data transfers from hosts. |
| Key Indicators | Unusual user agent strings in logs, especially those mimicking legitimate software or anonymized agents with no common usage patterns. Repeated access to configuration-related endpoints such as '/server-status', '/config', or '/settings' without proper authorization. Patterns of scanning activity where requests probe for detailed client version information. Indicators of phishing attempts requesting client configuration data. |
| Questions for Analysis | Are there any unfamiliar or suspicious user agent strings present in web server or proxy logs? Do the logs indicate any unusual scanning patterns or attempts to access configuration files directly? Have there been recent phishing-related alerts that coincide with attempts to gather client data? Are there anomalies in the data traffic that suggest unauthorized access to client configuration details? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if unusual user agent strings are detected, especially if they correlate with known malicious profiles, or if there are signs of coordinated scanning activity that targets client configuration endpoints. Also escalate if multiple indicators suggest either a coordinated phishing attempt or unauthorized data access without clear business justification. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Cross-reference detected user agent strings with threat intelligence sources to determine if they are associated with known threat actors or tools. Perform an initial review of phishing alerts to identify any direct relation with attempts to gather host information. Validate the legitimacy of the requests accessing client configuration endpoints by reviewing associated user credentials and source IPs. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct deeper investigation into the collected indicators such as suspicious user agent strings or configuration access attempts. Utilize advanced threat hunting tools to trace back the source of suspicious activities. Analyze the context of the events to determine if the activities are part of a larger campaign targeting client configurations. Engage with incident response to determine if immediate action is necessary to mitigate any discovered active threat. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Block identified malicious IP addresses and user agents at the network perimeter. Implement monitoring rules for repeated or unauthorized access attempts to configuration endpoints. Enhance phishing protection mechanisms to detect and thwart ongoing information-gathering attempts. Review and update security controls around access to client configuration data. Conduct a post-incident review to harden systems against future attempts and refine detection mechanisms. |
