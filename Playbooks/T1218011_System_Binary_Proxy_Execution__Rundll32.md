| Name | System Binary Proxy Execution: Rundll32 |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Security logs capturing process creation events, such as Windows Event Logs (specifically Event ID 4688), should be investigated for instances of rundll32.exe executions. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions that provide detailed process command-line arguments are essential. Network activity logs should be checked for unusual outbound connections, particularly those leading to known malicious or suspicious domains. |
| Key Indicators | Unusual execution of rundll32.exe particularly with command-line arguments invoking DLLs, .cpl files, or scripts. Look for commands like 'rundll32.exe {DLLname, DLLfunction}' or 'rundll32.exe file.dll,#1'. Monitor instances where rundll32.exe is making network connections or running scripts via URLs, as seen in patterns like 'https[:]//www[.]example[.]com/malicious.sct'. Investigate any rundll32.exe processes started by unexpected or unprivileged users. |
| Questions for Analysis | Is the rundll32.exe execution pattern consistent with legitimate software or system operations? Does the DLL or script being loaded by rundll32.exe align with known good software, or is it a new or unusual file? Are any outbound connections made by rundll32.exe going to unrecognized or potentially malicious domains? Is this behavior appearing on critical systems or high-value targets within the network? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if rundll32.exe is executing files from non-standard locations, or if the execution pattern is novel for the endpoint in question. Escalate if rundll32.exe is associated with network activity towards suspicious domains, or if there is evidence of masquerading techniques such as renamed DLLs or manipulated file extensions. Unusual behavior on critical systems also warrants escalation. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify the legitimacy of the DLLs or scripts executed by rundll32.exe by checking their file signatures and matching them against known good files. Review historical behavior of the device to determine if the execution pattern is an anomaly. Cross-reference any outbound connection domains against threat intelligence feeds to identify known malicious infrastructure. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct deeper forensic analysis on the affected systems to determine the origin and impact of the execution. Use memory analysis to search for indicators of malicious DLLs loaded in rundll32.exe. Analyze network traffic data for command and control communication indicators. Validate any file hashes against malware databases to determine potential threats. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further propagation. Capture memory dumps and relevant disk images for thorough analysis. Identify and remove malicious payloads loaded by rundll32.exe. Update security policies and configurations to prevent similar abuse of rundll32.exe and other system binary proxies. Monitor the environment for further signs of compromise. |
