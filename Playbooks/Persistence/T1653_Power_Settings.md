| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate Event Logs related to power management settings changes, specifically focusing on Windows Event Logs such as Security (Event ID 4670: Permissions on an object were changed), and System (Event ID 42: The system is entering sleep). Monitor system command-line activity logs, looking for unusual invocations of 'powercfg' or related commands. Utilize Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) logs for changes in power settings. SCCM (System Center Configuration Manager) audit logs or other configuration management tools could also be relevant as they track system configuration changes. For Linux systems, review 'syslog' and audit logs for commands such as 'systemctl' related to sleep/halt activities. |
| Key Indicators | Unusual command-line activity involving 'powercfg' with options to disable sleep or hibernate settings. Presence of scripts or automated tasks that adjust system power settings without clear justification. Sudden or unexplained changes in system uptime. Configuration changes logged that adjust timeout settings for lock screens or inactivity. Files or processes related to system shutdown or reboot missing or modified without administrative intervention. |
| Questions for Analysis | Has there been any recent increase in the power setting changes on the system? Are power management changes being executed by an unauthorized or non-standard user account? Do logs indicate persistence mechanisms that avoid reboots or shutdowns, such as deleted system files? Have there been similar power management alterations across multiple systems within a short time frame, suggesting a coordinated effort? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if power management changes are executed by an unknown or unauthorized user. Escalation is also required if there is evidence of missing or modified critical system files related to power options. If the system involved is critical to the organization or if the changes align with known malicious patterns, escalate for further analysis. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify user accounts performing power configuration changes; cross-reference with authorized users list. Investigate any associated scheduled tasks or scripts. Compare changes against baseline configurations for the impacted system. Review recent changes or installations that could be related to the TTP. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct deeper forensic analysis to identify any malicious scripts or binaries in the system. Utilize EDR tools to trace the source or parent process responsible for changes. Correlate with threat intelligence to determine if observed patterns match any known attack groups or malware. Analyze systems logs for network activity following the identified time of changes to spot additional malicious behavior. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Revert any unauthorized changes to power configurations immediately. Quarantine affected systems if they show signs of further compromise. Perform comprehensive malware scans across the affected host. Implement tighter monitoring on the network and affected endpoints to capture any further malicious activity. Review and strengthen policies around administrative access and power configuration changes. |
