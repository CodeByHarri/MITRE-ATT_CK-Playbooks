| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate logs from cloud identity and access management services such as AWS CloudTrail, Azure Active Directory Sign-ins and audit logs, and Google Cloud Audit Logs. Examples include: <br>- AWS CloudTrail logs for CreateUser and PutUserPolicy actions.<br>- Azure's AuditLogs and Sign-in logs for unusual user creation and modification activity.<br>- GCP Cloud Audit Logs for service account creation and role bindings. |
| Key Indicators | Key indicators of cloud account creation include:<br>- New user creation events that are not correlated with existing activity patterns.<br>- Service account creation logs with no associated legitimate change requests.<br>- Alerts on roles or permissions assigned to newly created accounts that exceed typical user privilege levels.<br>- Multiple account creations in a short time span, especially outside business hours. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Is the new account creation associated with an authorized user request?<br>2. Does the timing of account creation align with normal business hours?<br>3. Are there multiple account creation events in the same timeframe?<br>4. Are there any anomalies in the accounts' assigned roles or permissions?<br>5. Were there failed login attempts or permission denied messages recorded around the time of the account creation? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if:<br>- Account creation or role assignment cannot be justified by legitimate business operations.<br>- Account is given elevated permissions without corresponding change management documentation.<br>- Evidence of subsequent malicious or suspicious activity associated with the newly created account.<br>- Multiple suspicious account creations occurring simultaneously or within a short period. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Verify if the account creation corresponds to any recent change requests or authorized actions.<br>2. Check recent sign-in activity of the associated user to look for anomalies.<br>3. Confirm the location and IP address of the actions related to the creation event.<br>4. Review permissions and roles assigned to the new accounts for consistency with typical role assignments. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Conduct a deeper investigation on network traffic and endpoint data for signs of lateral movement using the new account.<br>2. Review historical account creation incidents for patterns or correlations.<br>3. Engage with responsible organizational units to confirm the legitimacy of the new accounts.<br>4. Examine any related access to sensitive data repositories or high-risk applications by suspect accounts. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. If unauthorized account activity is confirmed, disable or restrict the suspect accounts immediately.<br>2. Audit permissions and access logs to identify and remedy any unauthorized changes.<br>3. Implement monitoring for any further suspicious account activities.<br>4. Conduct a post-incident review to enhance cloud security policies and user management controls. |
