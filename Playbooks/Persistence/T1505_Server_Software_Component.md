| Name | Server Software Component |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate server application logs that may provide insights into new plugins, extensions, or modules being installed or loaded. Examples include web server logs (e.g., Apache, Nginx), application server logs (e.g., Tomcat, WebLogic), and any system logs around installation activities. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions can aggregate and correlate these logs for anomalous activity. Additionally, monitor change logs for the server's configuration files and directories containing server-side components. |
| Key Indicators | Unusual installation of new plugins or extensions not documented in change management records. Detection of scripts or binaries residing in server directories typically used for legitimate modules. Anomalous server behavior post-component installation, such as unexplained network activity or performance degradation. Discrepancies in server application behavior logs indicating unauthorized changes or function executions. |
| Questions for Analysis | Is there any record in change management approving installation of this component? Does the extension or plugin have verifiable attribution to a known vendor or developer? Are there any associated alerts or logs indicating similar activity from the same source IP? What are the results from virus/malware scans on the installed component? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if there is no change management record for the installation, if the component is associated with known malicious indicators, or if there are concurrent anomalies in the serverâ€™s performance suggesting unauthorized access. Additionally, escalate if the Tier 1 analyst cannot verify the legitimacy of the component through vendor sources. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Cross-reference the server component installation with existing change management records and software inventory. Verify integrity and origin of the newly installed component using hash checks and vendor documentation. Use SIEM to correlate any unusual network traffic patterns post-installation. Scan for malware and unexpected ports opened by the server post-installation. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Perform deeper forensic analysis of the installed component, checking for obfuscation techniques and reverse engineering if necessary. Review historical logs to determine the timeline of installation and access patterns related to the component. Contact the server's application support team or vendor for verification of typical behavior. Use threat intelligence to determine if there are any known CVEs or exploit patterns associated with the detected anomaly. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Isolate the server if malicious activity is confirmed, to prevent further compromise or data exfiltration. Remove or disable the suspicious components and perform a rollback to a known good configuration if possible. Conduct a full malware scan and penetration test to ensure no further vulnerabilities exist. Update and patch the server software and components to prevent future exploitation. Document and review incident handling procedures to improve response to similar threats in the future. |
