| Name | Remote Services: Windows Remote Management |
| Log Sources to Investigate | To investigate the use of Windows Remote Management (WinRM), consider reviewing logs from: 1. Windows Event Logs - Specifically, Security Event logs (Event ID 4624: Successful logon, Event ID 4648: Logon attempt using explicit credentials, Event ID 7045: A service was installed in the system) and PowerShell logs (Script Block logging and Module logging).<br>2. Network logs â€“ Monitor for WinRM port activity (default TCP 5985/5986).<br>3. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools that can capture process creation events, especially those involving 'winrm' commands or unusual activity from PowerShell. 4. Authentication logs from Active Directory for unusual or failed login attempts involving sensitive accounts. |
| Key Indicators | Key indicators include: 1. Unusual number of WinRM connections originating from a single source.<br>2. Frequent authentication attempts using various accounts on WinRM ports.<br>3. Unexpected execution of PowerShell scripts or commands via WinRM. 4. New services installation logs tied to remote interactions. 5. Modifications of system configurations or registry changes via WinRM. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Is there an increased frequency of logins via WinRM by accounts that typically do not use this service?<br>2. Are there any unsuccessful login attempts, and are they indicative of credential guessing or brute force attempts?<br>3. Has any unauthorized or unexpected software been installed via WinRM interactions? 4. Is there evidence of sensitive data access or exfiltration following WinRM sessions? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if: 1. There are repeated and failed login attempts indicating a brute force attack.<br>2. High-value or sensitive accounts are involved in abnormal WinRM activity.<br>3. Non-compliance with organizational usage policies regarding remote management tools. 4. Indicators suggest lateral movement or privilege escalation. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Check recent changes in user permissions and access rights.<br>2. Verify the legitimacy of user initiations on WinRM sessions by confirming with the owner of the credentials.<br>3. Correlate WinRM logs with other anomalous behaviors in network and endpoint activities. 4. Validate that the source IP and originating account are consistent with known behavior and locations. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Conduct a deeper analysis of network traffic involving suspected WinRM activity to identify potential data exfiltration.<br>2. Review historical account activity for anomalies or patterns that could indicate compromised credentials.<br>3. Perform endpoint forensic analysis to detect the presence of backdoors or additional unauthorized tools. 4. Work with IT to verify current security patches and configurations on systems accessed via WinRM. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Disable the WinRM service on affected systems if not business-critical.<br>2. Change passwords and consider account lockouts for accounts suspected of being compromised.<br>3. Utilize a SIEM to enhance monitoring for further suspicious WinRM activity. 4. Potentially isolate affected devices from the network for full forensic investigation. 5. Engage with threat intelligence to determine whether similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) are reported externally. |
