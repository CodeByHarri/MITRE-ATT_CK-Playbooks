| Name | Remote Service Session Hijacking: RDP Hijacking |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Focus on Windows Security Event Logs, especially Event ID 4776 (Credential Validation), Event ID 4624 (Logon), and Event ID 4625 (Failed Logon). Terminal Services Logs, specifically related to RDP, such as disconnections and reconnections of sessions, should be reviewed. Network Traffic Logs capturing RDP traffic (default port 3389) can also provide insights. Review command line execution logs via Sysmon or Windows Event ID 4688 for suspicious execution of tscon.exe. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions can give detailed insights into RDP-related activities. |
| Key Indicators | Look for execution of tscon.exe with unusual session numbers or executed by unexpected accounts. Sudden disconnection or reconnection of RDP sessions without user's typical logoff/on behavior. Anomalous logon behaviors in logs, such as multiple or failed logons around the time of the hijack. Network traffic showing unusual RDP connections, especially from internal devices that typically do not use RDP. Use of tscon.exe without corresponding user activity may be an indicator as well. |
| Questions for Analysis | Was tscon.exe executed, and if so, by whom and when? Are there any anomalous logon activities (e.g., failed attempts or unusual times)? Were there unexpected session disconnects or reconnects noted in the Terminal Services Logs? Is there any indication that the involved accounts had other suspicious activities or privilege escalation attempts? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate if there are confirmed instances of tscon.exe usage during times of suspected unauthorized access, especially if logs show privileged account activity (e.g., Domain Admin) during these times. Also, escalate if network logs indicate suspicious RDP sessions initiated from unusual IPs, or if an account shows other indicative signs of compromise alongside RDP hijacking activities. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify user activity logs for any session disconnections and reconnections. Check for any known IP addresses from threat intelligence feeds that appear in network logs related to RDP activity. Correlate the execution of tscon.exe with user activity logs to discern legitimate actions versus potential hijacking events. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct deeper analysis of the affected system to check for additional compromise signs, such as other lateral movements or installed malware. Review historic RDP audit logs for patterns. Examine user account and access control configurations to validate if misuse or misconfigurations facilitated the hijack. Perform a detailed trace of network activity before and after detected events for lateral movement activities. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Immediately isolate affected system(s) from the network to prevent further lateral movement. Initiate password resets for potentially compromised accounts. Conduct a full forensic analysis of the system for artifacts of RDP session hijacking, such as logon times or session commands. Consider enabling additional monitoring or deploying honeypot systems to detect re-attempts of RDP hijacking. |
