| Name | Exploitation of Remote Services |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Collect logs related to: 1) Network Traffic Logs - for anomalous traffic or connections to unusual ports/services; 2) Authentication Logs - to detect unusual login attempts or accesses related to compromised credentials; 3) Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) - to identify lateral movement activity or exploitation attempts; 4) Vulnerability Scanning Results - to understand known weaknesses; 5) Application and Server Logs - for errors or warnings indicating exploitation attempts (e.g., SMB or RDP logs). Example: Monitor for connections to SMB on non-standard ports or unpatched RDP services. |
| Key Indicators | Common indicators include: 1) Unusual network connections to services typically exposed to vulnerabilities (e.g., SMB, RDP); 2) Failed login attempts followed by a successful unauthorized access; 3) Exploit payloads/components being downloaded; 4) Correlated timing of network service scans followed by exploitation activity; 5) Known Exploit Signature Hits within IDS/IPS systems. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1) Are there unexpected network connections or traffic patterns toward known vulnerable services?<br>2) Was there a recent scan for vulnerabilities before the exploitation attempts?<br>3) Were there any spikes in failed authentication attempts followed by a successful login? 4) Is there corroborating evidence of an exploit attempt in vulnerability scan data? 5) Are there indications that indicate data exfiltration or privilege escalation attempts? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate if: 1) There are confirmed exploit attempts on known vulnerable services not aligned to legitimate software updates or configuration changes; 2) Successful lateral movement detected post-exploitation; 3) Indicators suggest data access or exfiltration following an exploitation attempt; 4) Evidence of privilege escalation associated with the exploitation activities. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1) Validate network traffic anomalies against known patterns of vulnerability exploitation.<br>2) Correlate failed and successful logins around the time exploitation was attempted.<br>3) Check historical vulnerability scans for exploited vulnerability presence. 4) Compare the source IPs with known bad IP lists. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1) Perform a deeper dive into affected systems to identify the extent of exploitation and possible data compromised.<br>2) Conduct an impact assessment to understand any system alterations or persistence mechanisms added.<br>3) Verify if the vulnerable software remains unpatched elsewhere in the network. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1) Isolate compromised systems from the network to prevent further lateral movement.<br>2) Apply necessary patches or security updates to vulnerable systems.<br>3) Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to identify the initial vector and any additional compromised hosts. 4) Monitor the network closely for any further exploitation attempts or suspicious activities. |
