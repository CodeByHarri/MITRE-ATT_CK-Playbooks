| Name | Data Staged |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate logs from file access and modifications, command execution logs, and cloud infrastructure logs. Examples include: <br>- File system logs that indicate new or modified files, particularly in staging directories.<br>- Command line logs from cmd or bash sessions that show copying or moving of data to central locations.<br>- Cloud service provider logs for activities such as instance creation, especially Create Cloud Instance events and VM activity logs.<br>- Network traffic logs focusing on data transfers to unfamiliar domains or IPs.<br>- Audit logs from data storage services to track access and changes in files. |
| Key Indicators | Key indicators may include: <br>- Creation of large files or archives in a short period of time.<br>- Increase in read, copy, or move operations in locations commonly used for staging.<br>- Unusual instance provisioning in cloud environments that does not align with normal operation patterns.<br>- Command execution that archives files or pulls together data from multiple sources.<br>- Network anomalies indicating large data movements or connections to atypical endpoints. |
| Questions for Analysis | Key analysis questions include: <br>- Have new files or archives recently appeared in common staging areas?<br>- Is there evidence of data aggregation or file archival based on file or command execution logs?<br>- Is there unusual network activity associated with data transfers, particularly to previously unobserved destinations?<br>- Were any new cloud instances initiated recently? Who initiated them and what activities are occurring there? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalation is warranted if:<br>- Large data files or archives are discovered in staging locations without legitimate business justification.<br>- Command-line activity indicates data staging without authorization.<br>- Anomalous cloud instance provisioning, especially when involving the storage or movement of significant data volume.<br>- Discovery of connections to anomalous network destinations associated with large data transfers. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | L1 analysts should:<br>- Verify the ownership and authorization of files or directories where data is staged.<br>- Review recent command-line history in suspect systems for file manipulation commands.<br>- Validate network logs to identify the scale and scope of data transfers.<br>- Check for any cloud instance spin-ups and correlate with known operational activities. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | T2 analysts should:<br>- Perform a deeper dive into the history of files or data sets staged and correlate them with user activity and permissions.<br>- Analyze network traffic for exfiltration patterns.<br>- Assess cloud service provider logs to confirm any unauthorized instance creation and data movements.<br>- Work with relevant teams to gather business context around detected data movements or storage. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | For containment and further steps:<br>- Isolate affected systems or VMs with anomalous staging behavior to prevent data exfiltration.<br>- Suspend or shut down unauthorized cloud instances pending further investigation.<br>- Implement network segmentation to restrict suspicious data flows.<br>- Conduct a post-incident review to identify gaps in monitoring and apply enhanced controls to prevent repeat incidents. |
