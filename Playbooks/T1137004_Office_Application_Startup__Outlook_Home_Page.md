| Name | Office Application Startup: Outlook Home Page |
| Log Sources to Investigate | To investigate this TTP, consider examining the following log sources: <br>1. Outlook Client Logs: Check for unusual configuration changes or URL settings in the home page feature. <br>2. Windows Event Logs: Look for events related to Outlook startup and folder access. <br>3. Network Traffic Logs: Analyze for unexpected outbound traffic patterns to unfamiliar external URLs, especially related to HTML content. <br>4. Email Gateway Logs: Search for any anomalies in email configuration changes.<br>Examples: Look for changes in folder home page settings, unexpected URLs loaded by Outlook, or unusual execution patterns. |
| Key Indicators | Key indicators of this activity include:<br>1. Modification of Outlook folder settings to include external URLs as home pages. <br>2. Network connections to external sites upon Outlook startup that do not match typical user behavior or corporate policy.<br>3. Presence of anomalous or unknown HTML code within the Outlook home page settings.<br>4. Alerts from security solutions regarding script execution within Outlook folders. |
| Questions for Analysis | Questions to guide analysis include:<br>1. Are there any recent changes in Outlook home page configurations? If so, who made them?<br>2. Does the configuration or accessed URL match typical user activity or corporate norms?<br>3. Is there a history of successful HTML execution logs or warnings associated with this setup?<br>4. Has the user reported any suspicious Outlook behavior or prompts? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalation should occur if:<br>1. There is confirmed manipulation of Outlook settings without a legitimate reason.<br>2. The URL or executed code is determined to be malicious or is unrecognized.<br>3. Related network traffic originates from the user’s system in conjunction with known Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).<br>4. Security tools have flagged corresponding activity that correlates with this TTP. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | For Level 1 analysts:<br>1. Validate the user's Outlook configuration logs for unauthorized modifications.<br>2. Check network logs for any suspicious connections initiated by the user’s machine when Outlook starts.<br>3. Ensure any anomalies are cross-referenced against the organization's threat intelligence feeds. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Actions for Tier 2 analysts:<br>1. Conduct deeper inspection of the HTML code or URLs involved to identify potential payloads or code execution.<br>2. Verify the authenticity of accessed URLs against corporate whitelisting policies.<br>3. Collaborate with IT and incident response teams to establish if there’s lateral movement or wider spread.<br>4. Provide a technical report summarizing the intent, risk, and mitigation suggestions based on the findings. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | For containment and further analysis:<br>1. Immediately revoke any unauthorized Outlook folder setups and reaffirm security policies.<br>2. Isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further spreading if malicious activity is confirmed.<br>3. Utilize endpoint detection solutions to quarantine and remediate any affected files.<br>4. Conduct a full forensic analysis to understand the scope and entry points of the attack, while strengthening monitoring and logging for improved future detection. |
