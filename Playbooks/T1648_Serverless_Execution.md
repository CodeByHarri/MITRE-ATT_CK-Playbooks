| MITRE Sub-TTP | T1648 |
| Name | Serverless Execution |
| Log Sources to Investigate | 1. Cloud service provider audit logs (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Logs, Google Cloud Audit Logs) to track serverless function creation, modification, and execution events.<br>2. Application logs from serverless functions to detect unauthorized or unusual execution patterns.<br>3. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems for correlating potentially anomalous activities related to serverless functions. 4. Alerts from Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) tools that monitor configurations and compliance postures in cloud environments. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Creation of new serverless functions with unfamiliar or non-standard naming conventions.<br>2. Modifications in serverless functions that include privilege escalations, such as additional role dependencies (e.g., IAM:PassRole in AWS).<br>3. Abnormal increase in serverless function activity levels, potentially indicating misuse or abuse (e.g., crypto-mining operations). 4. Unusual patterns of execution, such as execution shortly after IT personnel have left their working times or from atypical locations. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Is the serverless function executing commands or accessing resources that are uncommon for its normal operation?<br>2. Are there recent changes made to IAM roles that are being used by serverless functions?<br>3. Is there any indication of concurrent unauthorized access or compromised credentials associated with the serverless environment? 4. Has there been a sudden increase in the costs associated with serverless resource usage? 5. Are there any known security advisories or alerts linked to serverless execution within the particular provider's environment? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if: 1. There is evidence of unauthorized or malicious execution patterns in serverless function logs.<br>2. Key indicators suggest potential privilege escalation or execution of high-risk functions without a proper change control request.<br>3. A serverless function is persisting beyond expected or scheduled execution times or operational patterns, indicating a potential persistent threat. 4. Detection of any attempts at exfiltrating data or breaching internal data policies using serverless applications. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Verify and corroborate activity logs with known user activity to differentiate between sanctioned and unsanctioned actions.<br>2. Review recent administrative actions regarding serverless settings and identify deviations from established baselines.<br>3. Utilize a threat intelligence feed to match known IOCs with suspicious activities. 4. Identify any overlap between serverless function resource utilization and reported security issues or advisories related to privilege escalation. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Conduct deeper analysis of logs and correlate with historical data to identify patterns or repeated incidents suggesting potential threats.<br>2. Engage with cloud security engineers to review audit logs and configuration changes for unauthorized alterations to serverless function executions.<br>3. Implement temporary controls or restrictions on suspect serverless functions to contain possible malicious activities while maintaining critical operations. 4. Cross-reference suspicious activities with network logs for additional insights into origin IP addresses or accounts involved. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Temporarily suspend or disable potentially compromised serverless functions and apply stricter IAM policies to limit further exploitation.<br>2. Conduct a comprehensive review of serverless function permissions and roles, tightening security controls where necessary.<br>3. Implement alerting for unusual serverless execution metrics, such as execution frequency spikes or failed authorization attempts. 4. Engage incident response team to perform forensic analysis if there is a confirmed breach, and update security protocols based on findings. 5. Prepare a report detailing the incident, actions taken, and recommendations for future prevention. |
