| Name | Supply Chain Compromise: Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Version control system logs (e.g., Git, SVN) can reveal unexpected changes or commits to software dependencies. Build server logs (e.g., Jenkins, Bamboo) can show manipulated build processes or the addition of unauthorized dependencies. Software repository management tools (e.g., Nexus, Artifactory) can identify unusual artifacts or repository changes. Network logs may show unusual data exfiltration or communication with suspicious IPs/URLs, especially if the compromise tool downloads additional payloads. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) logs can indicate execution of unexpected software or tools. |
| Key Indicators | Unapproved changes or commits in code repositories, especially those that add or modify dependencies. Presence of unexpected or unauthorized code in dependency files. Network traffic to suspicious domains or IP addresses, particularly after new software or updates are applied. Execution of unsigned or unexpected binaries and scripts. Alterations in build scripts that were not documented or approved. |
| Questions for Analysis | Are there unapproved or unexpected commits in software repositories? Have any new dependencies been added recently without proper vetting? Is there unusual or unexpected network traffic following the installation of updates or new software? Are there indications of execution of new binaries/scripts that are not part of official software updates? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if there are unauthorized changes to repository dependencies, if anomalies in build processes are identified, or if suspicious traffic is confirmed and tied to recent software changes. If any malicious indicators (such as new suspicious binaries) are confirmed, immediate escalation is warranted. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Review recent commits to repositories and cross-verify them with approval logs. Check the authenticity and verification of any new software dependencies. Monitor network traffic for suspicious communication patterns after deployment of new software. Verify signatures of executed binaries. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Correlate indicators from L1 with threat intelligence for known indicators of compromise. Reverse engineer suspicious binaries to determine their function and intent. Validate any identified suspicious domains against known threat lists and assess their behavior. Conduct deeper packet analysis on unusual communication patterns to understand data flow and context. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Isolate affected systems to prevent further spread if suspicion of compromise is confirmed. Revert software repositories to last known good state and rebuild software without the compromised dependencies. Block identified malicious domains/IPs at the firewall/proxy level. Implement stricter access controls and review dependency management practices to prevent future incidents. Conduct a thorough investigation to ensure all compromised elements are identified and remediated. |
