| Name | Automated Collection |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Monitor command line activity logs for unusual use of scripting interpreters, such as PowerShell, Bash, or Python scripts, which could automate data collection. Review SIEM logs for API calls in cloud environments, particularly those accessing data pipelines or ETL services. Check Windows Event Logs and Sysmon for file access patterns that deviate from the norm. Cloud service logs, such as AWS CloudTrail or Azure Monitor, should be scrutinized for unauthorized or unusual API activity. |
| Key Indicators | Frequent invocation of command line tools or scripts that access or move large quantities of data. High frequency API calls to sensitive services or resources in cloud environments. Scheduled tasks or cron jobs that don't match normal operation schedules. Unexpected access to or from cloud storage services or the presence of automated data extraction scripts. |
| Questions for Analysis | Are there signs of abnormal automation in command or script execution? Is there unusual access to or from cloud data storage services? Are there continuous data movements that coincide with unauthorized scheduled tasks? Does the pattern of API access or command execution align with legitimate business activity? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate if there are multiple corroborating signs of automated data collection that cannot be attributed to legitimate business processes or if potential data exfiltration is detected. Escalate if command or script execution patterns match known malicious behavior or if unauthorized API access in cloud services is identified. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Review recent changes or new entries in system schedules like Windows Task Scheduler and Linux cron jobs. Verify the legitimacy of the users or scripts running scheduled tasks or accessing cloud APIs. Cross-check unusual command execution against known scripts within the organization. Correlate identified patterns with organizational behavior baselines and update with common adversarial techniques. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Perform a deeper investigation into the origins of scripts and commands, examining the integrity and origin of the potentially malicious components. Conduct threat intelligence matching to associate the observed behavior with known threat actors. Analyze network traffic to detect data exfiltration attempts or patterns indicative of persistent data collection. Pivot to related accounts or systems for comprehensive impact analysis. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Immediately disable any identified malicious scheduled tasks or scripts. Block unauthorized API access or cloud service usage at the firewall or IAM level. Implement data collection monitoring to alert on continued unauthorized activity. Forensically image affected systems for further analysis, ensuring data preservation for potential legal evidence. Engage with IT or incident response teams to remediate and strengthen security measures against identified weaknesses. |
