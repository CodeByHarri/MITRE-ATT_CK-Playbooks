| Name | Data from Local System |
| Log Sources to Investigate | 1. File system audit logs: Check for logs that capture read access or enumeration events for directories and files, especially those containing sensitive data.<br>2. Command line activity logs: Monitor logs from command interpreters like cmd.exe for suspicious commands that enumerate files or access databases.<br>3. Network device logs: Capture command-line interface (CLI) access and commands run on network devices, focusing on commands related to configuration extraction. 4. Automated tools execution logs: Look for execution patterns from known automated collection tools. Examples include PowerShell logs, Sysmon event logs capturing process creation, and native OS event logs like Windows Event ID 5145 for file share access. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Repeated access or enumeration of sensitive directories or files, especially by non-privileged users.<br>2. Unusual command line parameters associated with file or directory listing commands (e.g., 'dir C:\SensitiveDocs').<br>3. Execution of network device CLI commands specific to configuration dumping or information gathering. 4. Indicators of automated script or tool use for file system traversal, such as frequent execution of system-native commands in short succession. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. What user account performed the data access and is it typical for this account to access such data?<br>2. Is there any known justification or recent change related to configurations or file access that could explain these activities?<br>3. Were there any recent security incidents or anomalies associated with the user or system involved? 4. Are the accessed files or databases marked as sensitive or restricted in access policies? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if: 1. The user account accessing the data lacks appropriate privileges.<br>2. There is no legitimate business justification for accessing the files.<br>3. The pattern of access closely matches known malicious activities or previous incidents. 4. Associated indicators suggest the use of command line or automated tools aligned with adversarial behavior. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Verify the identity and activity history of the user account involved.<br>2. Check for known legitimate access patterns or maintenance windows that might explain the activity.<br>3. Gather related logs over the same window of time to identify any concurrent suspicious activities. 4. Look for typical threat actor usage patterns in the accessed files or systems. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of the accessed systems to identify any further suspicious patterns or data exfiltration attempts.<br>2. Network traffic analysis to detect related anomalous connections, potentially correlating with exfiltration.<br>3. Analyze compromised accounts for signs of credential theft or lateral movement. 4. Review and coordinate with IT to ensure that all sensitive data is properly protected and monitored. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Isolate affected systems if unauthorized data access is confirmed to prevent further access or exfiltration.<br>2. Reset credentials and review access permissions for involved user accounts.<br>3. Perform a comprehensive data inventory and review security policies related to data protection to prevent recurrence. 4. Communicate findings to relevant stakeholders and reinforce security awareness about data handling practices. |
