| Name | Input Capture |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate endpoint security logs for indications of input capture mechanisms being installed, such as unusual user activity logs or unauthorized software installation logs. Check Windows Event Logs for unusual loads of DLLs that could indicate Credential API Hooking. Review web server logs if Web Portal Capture tactics might be in play. Look for anomalous patterns in keyboard/mouse input telemetry, unusual access to shared drives, or changes in file integrity monitoring reports. |
| Key Indicators | Presence of unusual DLL files in System32 directory, anomalous use of API functions related to user input capture (e.g., GetKeyState, SetWindowsHookEx), sudden changes in user behavior such as logging input at odd times, or unexpected SSH or RDP sessions. Detecting unknown scripts making network connections to external IP addresses or abnormal process invocation chains could also indicate compromise. |
| Questions for Analysis | Are there unexplained new software installations that coincide with observed anomalous behavior? Have there been any recent changes to user access permissions or configurations that could enable input capture? Are there unexpected network traffic patterns, especially to/from new IP addresses associated with sensitive parts of the network? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if input capture methods are verified by matching key indicators, especially if sensitive credentials may have been exposed or exfiltration attempts are detected (e.g., a process continually creating network connections to unfamiliar external IPs). Escalate if there's confirmation of unauthorized access or if the organization is experiencing simultaneous, unusual log-on activities indicating potential broad-based credential theft. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify the presence of any suspect software installed or running on the system using endpoint detection and response tools. Cross-reference any suspicious DLLs or software with known threat intelligence feeds or malware repositories. Capture a snapshot of the process tree and active network connections on affected endpoints for further analysis. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct a deep-dive forensic analysis into the identified system to confirm the method and scope of input capture. Utilize sandbox environments to safely analyze any discovered suspicious executables or scripts. Correlate findings with ongoing threat intelligence reports and determine if this activity is part of a larger campaign. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further credential captures or data exfiltration. If possible, disable or remove detected malicious input capture tools. Reissue credentials and enforce a wider-scale password reset if there's evidence of credential compromise. Utilize endpoint recovery tools to restore systems to a known good state. Monitor network traffic for signs of additional or continuing malicious activity. |
