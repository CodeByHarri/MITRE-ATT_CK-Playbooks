| Name | Data Staged: Local Data Staging |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate file access logs for unusual read/write operations in atypical directories, especially locations not generally used for data storage. Check process logs for command-line activity involving `cmd` or `bash` executing copy or move commands. Review event logs for indications of data aggregation over a short period. Monitor registry access logs for abnormal registry value creation or modification, particularly involving storage routines. Example log sources include Windows Event Logs, Sysmon logs for file and registry operations, PowerShell logs, and File Integrity Monitoring solutions. |
| Key Indicators | Presence of files or archives in unexpected directories typically not used for data storage. Command-line usage showing file copy/move commands directed at staging directories. High volume data aggregation events in a short timeframe. Unexpected or uncommon process activity related to data manipulation or storage in logs. Registry keys being used to store data unexpectedly. |
| Questions for Analysis | Are the directories involved in data staging normal for user or application behavior? Are there any known legitimate applications that could explain this behavior? Does the file type or content match typical data formats used by legitimate business functions? Is the timing of these events aligned with regular system or user activity? Is there evidence of known malicious file or process signatures? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate if staged data involves sensitive or confidential information, or if files match known malicious formats. Escalate if unusual data staging coincides with other suspicious activities such as network connections to suspicious IPs. Escalate if there's no legitimate business justification for the observed data staging. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Review file and process creation times to check for patterns indicative of staging activity. Compare staged data with known legitimate business processes. Evaluate user login patterns to check for anomalous behavior. Check for recent installation of new software or scripts that might be legitimately performing these actions. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct deeper inspection of staged files for sensitive data content or malicious code. Correlate data staging events with possible exfiltration activities. Perform retrospective analysis across historical data logs to identify if this behavior is persistent or recurring. Engage threat intelligence to identify if there are any active advisories or alerts related to similar TTPs. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Isolate affected systems to prevent potential data exfiltration. Quarantine identified malicious archives or files. Conduct a full disk scan on affected systems for other signs of compromise. Review and possibly reset affected user credentials. Implement monitoring for similar future behaviors across the network. Document the incident comprehensively for further learning and improvement of detection mechanisms. |
