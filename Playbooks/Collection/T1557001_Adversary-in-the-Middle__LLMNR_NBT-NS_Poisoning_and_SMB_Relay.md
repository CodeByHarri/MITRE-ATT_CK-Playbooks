| Name | Adversary-in-the-Middle: LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Network traffic logs focusing on UDP port 5355 (LLMNR) and UDP port 137 (NBT-NS). Authentication logs from Active Directory or other identity management infrastructure to identify unusual authentication patterns. Network intrusion detection/prevention systems (NIDS/NIPS) for Name Service Poisoning and Malformed Packet anomalies. SMB traffic logs to detect anomalous SMB sessions and potential relaying activities. |
| Key Indicators | Unexpected or abnormal network traffic on UDP port 5355 and 137, especially responses to name queries. Authentication attempts using NTLMv1/v2 hashes in unexpected contexts, especially from unfamiliar or unauthorized systems. Discovery of responder tools in the network or on host machines. Abnormal SMB traffic patterns, particularly involving NTLM authentication attempts. |
| Questions for Analysis | Are there any legitimate services that should be communicating over UDP ports 5355 and 137 with the queried hosts? Are NTLM authentication attempts originating from expected and authorized systems? Is there evidence of any tools or scripts on the network indicative of Responder or similar utilities? Are there any identifiable legitimate reasons for SMB relay-like behavior occurring at this time? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to T2 if unexpected or unverifiable traffic on UDP 5355/137 is seen alongside NTLM hash authentication attempts. Escalate if network monitoring reveals the presence of unauthorized responder-like tools. Escalate if suspicious SMB relay traffic is detected and cannot be sourced to normal business processes. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify known services using UDP ports 5355 and 137 and document deviations in typical patterns. Check for indicators of Responder or similar tool utilization on host systems. Conduct a preliminary review of authentication logs for unusual NTLM use, particularly regarding unexpected sources and destinations. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Deploy enhanced network traffic analysis to confirm name service poisoning and SMB relay activities. Utilize host-based analyses to search for unauthorized responder tools. Cross-reference NTLM hash traffic with known authentication attempts to isolate the source and purpose. Conduct an environmental check for unauthorized or misconfigured systems that could be participating in poisoning or relaying. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Immediately block malicious or unauthorized systems detected engaging in LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning or SMB relay on the network. Quarantine hosts identified as running unauthorized versions of Responder or related tools. Implement strict network segmentation to minimize exposure to such attacks. Validate and enforce strong, complex password policies to reduce the effectiveness of brute force. Conduct a thorough post-incident review to ensure all compromised accounts and vectors are secured. |
