| Name | Archive Collected Data |
| Log Sources to Investigate | To effectively investigate T1560 - Archive Collected Data, analysts should focus on the following log sources: <br>1. File Access Logs: Monitor logs that capture file creation and modification, especially for common archive formats (e.g., .zip, .rar, .7z) and encryption utilities (e.g., .gpg, .enc).<br>2. Process Execution Logs: Look for processes that correlate with common archiving and encryption tools, such as 'zip', 'tar', '7z', 'gpg', 'openssl'. <br>3. Network Traffic Logs: Examine outbound network connections that coincide with known exfiltration activities, especially connections with significant data transfers. <br>4. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Logs: EDR solutions can identify and alert on the execution of unusual file compression or encryption activities. <br>5. System Logs: Check for unusual spikes in resource usage (CPU, memory) which may indicate large-scale data archiving or encryption operations. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Sudden creation of large archive files or unusual file encryption activity on a system or server.<br>2. Execution of command-line utilities related to file archiving and encryption.<br>3. Anomalous outbound traffic patterns indicating possible data exfiltration (e.g., large data transfers, unusual destination IPs). <br>4. Use of non-standard ports for communications indicative of potential data exfiltration.<br>5. Presence of temporary files related to compression utilities in suspicious directories. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Are there recent processes or commands related to data archiving or encryption on the affected machine?<br>2. Is there evidence of attempted or successful data exfiltration via network logs?<br>3. Does the user activity correspond with their normal usage patterns, or is there an anomaly?<br>4. Are there correlated alerts from multiple sources indicating a blend of compression/encryption and potential exfiltration actions?<br>5. Is the source IP address associated with known malicious activity or suspect domains? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if: <br>1. There is confirmation of unauthorized archiving or encryption of sensitive data. <br>2. Network logs demonstrate large outbound data transfers matching archive creation times. <br>3. Multiple correlated alerts from different log sources suggest coordinated malicious activity. <br>4. User activity history shows deviations or signs of account compromise linked to the TTP. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Verify the legitimacy of the archive/encryption tools used by checking installed software and approved applications.<br>2. Correlate user activity with network and process logs to confirm whether the activity is part of normal business processes.<br>3. Query for recent changes in access permissions that might have allowed unauthorized data access.<br>4. Utilize threat intelligence to check IP addresses, domains, and file hashes against known malicious indicators. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Conduct deeper forensic analysis on the system to track the full scope of data access and modifications.<br>2. Leverage threat intelligence sources to verify whether the artifacts match known patterns of advanced persistent threats (APTs) or commodity malware.<br>3. Examine network traffic with additional focus on identifying exfiltrated data payloads.<br>4. Validate whether encryption keys or passphrases can be recovered for encrypted data. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Isolate potentially compromised systems to prevent further data exfiltration.<br>2. Increase monitoring for unusual outbound connections from the network perimeter.<br>3. Perform a comprehensive audit of data access controls and enforce stricter policy if necessary.<br>4. Review and update incident response plans and prevention controls based on learnings from the event analysis.<br>5. If data exfiltration is confirmed, engage with relevant departments (legal, PR) to manage the breach response appropriately. |
