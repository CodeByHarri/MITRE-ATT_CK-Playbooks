| Name | Data from Configuration Repository: SNMP (MIB Dump) |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Network traffic logs, specifically focusing on SNMP traffic (ports 161/162). Device logs from network infrastructure such as switches, routers, and SNMP management servers. SNMP trap logs for anomalies and unexpected queries. System logs from devices known to have SNMP configured. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) correlated alerts that involve SNMP OIDs and SNMP-related anomalies. |
| Key Indicators | Unusual increase in SNMP queries or traffic volume, especially from hosts that do not typically query SNMP. SNMP requests from unauthorized or non-whitelisted IP addresses. Access attempts to SNMP community strings, especially 'public' or 'private' strings. Attempts to access OIDs indicative of sensitive or critical infrastructure configurations. Unexpected SNMP GET or WALK operations. |
| Questions for Analysis | Is the source IP address recognized and authorized to query SNMP on this network? Is there a legitimate business purpose for the observed SNMP activity? Are the SNMP community strings used typical for the organization, or do they appear default or suspicious? Are there any correlated alerts or logs suggesting a broader attack pattern involving this IP or user account? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if the SNMP traffic is originating from external or non-whitelisted internal IP addresses. Escalate if the activity includes attempts to access unauthorized SNMP community strings or requests OIDs beyond standard operational requirements. Escalate if there is a correlation with other suspicious activity indicating possible reconnaissance or active exploitation. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify the source and destination of the SNMP traffic in network logs. Cross-reference with known good configurations and inventories to identify anomalies. Check access control lists (ACLs) and firewall rules for any recent changes affecting SNMP traffic flow. Review the SNMP configurations on involved devices to ensure they match organizational policies. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Perform a deep dive into network traffic captures to analyze the payload of SNMP requests. Validate whether there have been any successful SNMP walk operations that accessed sensitive data. Investigate any unauthorized attempts to dump the MIB. Depending on findings, consider temporarily blocking or rate-limiting SNMP traffic from or to suspect hosts. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Isolate affected hosts and network segments if a breach is confirmed. Update SNMP community strings and implement stronger access controls such as IP whitelisting. Consider disabling SNMP on devices where it is not strictly necessary or configure SNMPv3 for enhanced security. Conduct a full security audit of SNMP configurations across the network infrastructure. Consider deploying additional monitoring tools capable of detecting SNMP-specific anomalies. |
