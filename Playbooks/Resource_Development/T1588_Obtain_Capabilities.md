| Name | Obtain Capabilities |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Network traffic logs to monitor connections to known malicious domains or IPs providing capabilities. Proxy logs for unusual download patterns or access to malware and exploit libraries. Endpoint monitoring logs for activities related to installation of unlicensed software or newly identified malicious software. Email security logs for suspicious communications with unknown senders potentially linked to the distribution of exploits or malware. Logs from digital certificate monitoring solutions to detect unauthorized acquisition of SSL/TLS or code-signing certificates. |
| Key Indicators | Unusual outbound network traffic to IP addresses associated with criminal marketplaces or known malicious infrastructure. Downloads of large files or tools from domains associated with malware or exploit distribution. Unexpected use of digital certificates for signing code. Alerts from endpoint security solutions indicating installation of unauthorized or potentially harmful software. Communication with email addresses related to adversarial entities known for distributing exploits. |
| Questions for Analysis | Is the network traffic consistent with legitimate business requirements? Are there any business justifications for downloading the detected software? Are the digital certificates being used in unexpected contexts or by unauthorized users? Have these IPs or domains been previously flagged for suspicious activities? Are the downloaded files recognized by security solutions as potential threats? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if the traffic is destined for or originates from high-risk countries, if digital certificates are being used to sign code without documentation, or if downloads include known malware or exploit kits. Escalate if endpoint solutions detect high-risk tools or software lacking legitimate licensing. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify if the destination IPs or domains are included in any threat intelligence feeds as known malicious actors. Attempt to associate downloaded files with known hash values in threat intelligence databases. Check for anomalies in user behavior or deviations from established baseline activity. Look for any correlated alerts that may indicate a broader compromise. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Perform deeper packet analysis of flagged network traffic. Validate software purchases and licenses with internal procurement records. Use digital certificate transparency logs to investigate potential misuse. Analyze user behavior analytics to understand if the behavior deviates significantly from usual patterns. Corroborate findings with threat intelligence for attribution and potential attack motivations. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Block network access to confirmed malicious domains/IPs. Remove any identified unauthorized software or malware from endpoints. Revoke any compromised or improperly used digital certificates. Notify involved parties of necessary actions regarding unauthorized software or certificates. Continue monitoring for indicators of additional unauthorized acquisitions and ensure all identified threats are documented and used to update current threat models. |
