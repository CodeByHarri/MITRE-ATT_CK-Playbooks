| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate development environments such as Git repositories, source code management tools, and CI/CD logs for unusual activity. Analyze network traffic logs for signs of fuzzing tools or unusual connections indicative of vulnerability probing. Monitor endpoint logs for suspicious use of debugging tools or shell commands indicative of exploit development or testing. Look for signs of changes in system binaries or libraries which might indicate patch analysis or reverse engineering efforts. Example log sources include GitLab logs, Jenkins build logs, Wireshark packet captures, and sysmon endpoint monitoring logs. |
| Key Indicators | Key indicators include: frequent pull requests or code changes to critical system components; unusual repository activity such as new branches focusing on security testers' accounts; high volume of outbound traffic from development environments; use of known fuzzing tools within network traffic; evidence of reverse engineering tools like IDA Pro or Ghidra being used on endpoints; and sudden changes to configurations or deployments without official documentation or approvals. |
| Questions for Analysis | Are there ongoing development projects specifically targeting vulnerabilities? Is the network traffic consistent with known fuzzing operations or reverse engineering? Are the source code changes related to legitimate bug fixes or enhancements, or do they closely align with vulnerability exploitation? Are there unauthorized or unexpected user account activities within the source code repositories? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if any instance of exploit-specific tools (e.g., fuzzers, debuggers) is found linked to active development on critical systems without clear, documented authorization. Any confirmed deviation from standard development processes indicating exploit development, or unauthorized access and changes in code repositories, should be escalated immediately. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Correlate unusual repository actions with login activity to identify potential compromised accounts. Review recent patches against repositories for undocumented changes correlated with known vulnerabilities. Scan for unauthorized applications or tools installed on development stations. Cross-reference network logs with known IP addresses of exploit tool sources. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct a deeper investigation into the intent behind flagged code changes and repository actions. Use threat intelligence feeds to compare flagged traffic patterns with known campaigns involving exploit development. Engage with the development team to validate the legitimacy of the actions and tools used. If needed, conduct interviews or checks with personnel involved in repository changes to assess for compromised individuals or social engineering. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Isolate the involved systems to prevent further potential exploit testing against other components. Perform forensic analysis on endpoint devices suspected of participating in unsolicited exploit activities. Develop patch or mitigation plans if new vulnerabilities are identified through the technology stack. Work with IT to ensure tight control over repository access and enforce enhanced logging around development environments. |
