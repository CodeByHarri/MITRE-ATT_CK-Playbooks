| Name | Compromise Accounts: Social Media Accounts |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Review web proxy logs for unusual social media access patterns, such as login attempts from various IP addresses or unfamiliar geolocations. Check authentication logs for failed login attempts or suspicious password resets on corporate social media management tools. Inspect network traffic logs for connections to known credential phishing sites. Examine user activity logs on social media platforms to observe changes in profile information or the addition of unusual friends or followers. |
| Key Indicators | Observe login attempts from foreign IP addresses or geolocations inconsistent with the userâ€™s normal activity. Detect password changes or resets followed by a sudden spike in account activity, such as sending messages or posting content. Note unusual patterns in friend or follower additions within a short timeframe. Identify the presence of known phishing domain URLs in browser activity logs. Look for new software or browser extensions installed shortly before the suspicious activity began. |
| Questions for Analysis | Have there been recent login attempts from locations or devices not previously associated with the user? Were there any deviations in typical usage patterns, such as frequent, rapid changes in profile connections? Are there any known breaches or phishing alerts that coincide with the suspicious activity? Has the user reported any difficulty accessing their account or noticed any unfamiliar changes? Is there any evidence of unauthorized access in system or application security logs? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if there is confirmed unauthorized access based on log analysis, especially if related to foreign access points, or if phishing site browsing activity is detected. Consider escalation if multiple indicators correlate with a known threat or if there is user-reported compromise in conjunction with observed suspicious activity. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Cross-reference recent authentication activity with known phishing indicators or domain lists. Confirm with the user if recent activity aligns with their behavior; if not, collect detailed account actions post-suspicious login. Monitor for further unauthorized profile changes or connections. Assess overall network logs for potential lateral movement from compromised accounts. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Perform deep dive into the network and endpoint security logs around the timeframe of the suspicious activities. Examine further any anomalies in social media account data structures for unauthorized changes. Leverage threat intelligence feeds to determine if compromised data corresponds with any known breaches. Initiate conversations with the affected user for detailed incident reconstruction. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Contact relevant social media platform security teams to temporarily suspend or reclaim control over the compromised account. Implement immediate password resets and evaluate applying multi-factor authentication if not already active. Conduct a full security sweep on the user's device(s) for malware. Post-containment, conduct a thorough review of permission levels for the compromised accounts to ensure minimum necessary access going forward. Provide awareness training or alerts to reduce the risk of future compromises. |
