| Name | Stage Capabilities: Install Digital Certificate |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Examine server logs, especially web and email server logs, for any entries related to SSL/TLS certificate installation. Check security logs and endpoint detection systems for processes installing SSL/TLS certificates. Review certificate management logs for issuance or installation events. Monitor network traffic logs for encrypted connections on non-standard ports. Example logs include `Apache/Nginx` server logs, `Exchange` server logs, and logs from security appliances like `SIEM` and `IDS/IPS` that can highlight unusual certificate usage. |
| Key Indicators | Sudden installation of new SSL/TLS certificates on servers. Detection of self-signed certificate usage. Unusual certificate metadata, such as unexpected issuer or short validity periods. Encrypted traffic to/from uncommon or suspicious IP addresses. Certificate management alerts for new certificates matching patterns used by known threat actors. Monitoring for any deviations in standard certificate chain paths. |
| Questions for Analysis | Is the certificate installed by a trusted administrator or team? Is the issuing Certificate Authority (CA) known and reputable? Was the same certificate used in previous known malicious activities? Are the encrypted communications consistent with normal business operations? Have there been similar incidents reported by other systems or third party threat intelligence feeds? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate if the certificate is self-signed or issued by an untrusted CA, especially if related to known malicious activity. Escalate if certificate installation coincides with other indicators of compromise (IoC), such as unauthorized remote access or data exfiltration events. Escalate if there is a high volume of encrypted traffic to/from newly identified or flagged infrastructure. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Validate the legitimacy of the certificate with system owners. Check if the issuing CA is part of the organizationâ€™s approved list. Search for any associated alerts or incidents within the same timeframe. Review any recent changes or activities in infrastructure management panels or configuration changes. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Correlate suspicious certificate activities with other extended detection sources. Investigate if impacted infrastructure participates in any known malicious campaigns. Use threat intelligence services to determine if observed certificate and IP addresses are associated with adverse activities. Analyze network traffic for anomalies post-certificate installation. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Revoke any unauthorized certificates immediately. Implement firewall rules to block traffic to/from compromised infrastructure. Engage with the certificate issuer to report malicious intent. Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on affected systems to identify potential breaches or further compromise. Ensure all legitimate certificates are issued with multi-factor authentication and monitor further issuance closely. |
