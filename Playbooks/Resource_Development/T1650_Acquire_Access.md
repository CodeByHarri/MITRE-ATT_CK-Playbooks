| Name | Acquire Access |
| Log Sources to Investigate | The primary log sources to investigate for this TTP include network traffic logs, remote access service logs, credentials access logs, and endpoint detection and response (EDR) telemetry. Network traffic logs should be examined for unusual access patterns, especially connections from previously unknown IP addresses, or traffic to and from external remote services. Remote access logs, such as VPN or RDP logs, should be checked for unusual logon attempts, especially those at odd hours or from unexpected locations. Monitor authentication attempts and review credential usage across the network. Endpoint logs should be analyzed for signs of malicious software installations following potential access acquisition. |
| Key Indicators | Key indicators for detecting this TTP include unusual or new connections to remote services, access from IP addresses known to be associated with threat actors or listed in threat intelligence repositories, multiple failed login attempts from an external IP address, successful logins from IPs in different geographic locations within a short timeframe, changes in privileged account behavior, and the appearance of unknown software or scripts on organizational endpoints. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Were the remote access attempts from known or expected IP addresses?<br>2. Is the source IP address associated with any known malicious activity?<br>3. Have there been multiple failed login attempts from this IP address recently? 4. Is there a sudden increase in network traffic originating from a specific endpoint to external IPs? 5. Have new tools or backdoors been identified on the system in question? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalation to Tier 2 is necessary if there is evidence of successful unauthorized logins from suspicious IP addresses, indications of malware presence following remote access, or any confirmation of actions through a potential acquired access. Also, escalation is warranted if there are ties to Threat Intelligence indicating a known threat actor or group. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Perform WHOIS lookups on suspicious IP addresses.<br>2. Correlate suspicious access attempts with known threat intelligence.<br>3. Check for newly installed software on endpoints involved in suspicious access attempts. 4. Review recent changes in account privileges or usage of high-privilege accounts. 5. Cross-reference suspicious activities with geolocation data to identify improbable logon scenarios. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Validate initial findings with deeper inspection of logs.<br>2. Use threat intelligence platforms to identify known TTPs associated with observed activities.<br>3. Analyze endpoint behavior for signs of persistence mechanisms being deployed. 4. Coordinate with network administrators to capture and inspect suspicious traffic in real-time. 5. Investigate any instances of lateral movement within the network from initially compromised endpoints. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | For containment, isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further compromise. Disable accounts that have been used during suspicious activities and force a password reset. Update security policies to block known malicious IP addresses and apply two-factor authentication where possible. For further analysis, conduct a forensic analysis on isolated systems to determine the scope of the breach and identify any additional compromised systems. Ensure all findings are documented and communicated to relevant parties, and update the security posture based on lessons learned from the incident. |
