| Log Sources to Investigate | Monitor cloud provider activity logs (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Logs, Google Cloud Audit Logs) for account creation activities. Check email server logs for new account registration emails. Review identity and access management (IAM) logs for new user provisioning. Investigation should also include log data from cloud management platforms and any associated financial transaction records for anomalous purchases related to cloud resources. |
| Key Indicators | Unusual cloud account creations, especially outside normal business hours; burst of new account creations from unusual IP addresses or geolocations; newly registered email addresses with minimal activity history used for cloud account setup; unexpected user roles or permissions granted to newly created accounts; anomalies in resource acquisition such as spikes in cloud service usage. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Are there multiple new cloud accounts being created from unusual IP addresses?<br>2. Are the new accounts associated with rarely or never-before-seen email domains?<br>3. Is there any concurrent anomalous behavior associated with these new accounts, such as large data transfers or unexpected services being used? 4. Have there been any prior security incidents associated with IP addresses related to the new accounts? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if there are multiple indicators suggesting unauthorized account creation, especially if linked to known malicious IP addresses or if unusual access patterns are detected post-creation. Escalation is also warranted if new accounts are found with higher-than-expected privileges or if they are used for suspicious infrastructure purchases. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify the legitimacy of the email addresses used for registrations; correlate the geolocations of the IP addresses used for account creations with known employee locations; look for patterns indicating automated or scripted behaviors; check for any alerts related to potential compromise of associated email accounts. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct deeper inspection of cloud platform configurations and audit logs; use threat intelligence sources to verify if IPs or domains associated with the new accounts are flagged for malicious activities; engage with the user or department purportedly responsible for the new account, if legitimate, to verify purpose and necessity; map any acquired resources to expected business needs or projects. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | If unauthorized accounts are confirmed, disable the accounts immediately and assess any potential access or activities conducted with them. Re-evaluate the IAM policies to enhance security; consider implementing stricter multi-factor authentication (MFA) and user behavior analytics; conduct a forensic investigation of linked activities and systems to identify any data leakage or lateral movement. Coordinate with cloud service providers for additional logs or insights where necessary. |
