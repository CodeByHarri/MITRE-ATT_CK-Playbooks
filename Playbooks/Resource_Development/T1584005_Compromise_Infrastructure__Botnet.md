| Name | Compromise Infrastructure: Botnet |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Network traffic logs to detect unusual patterns such as spikes in outbound traffic or connections to known malicious IP addresses. Firewall logs for signs of mass connections to external hosts. IDS/IPS logs for signature matches related to botnet activity. DNS logs to identify lookups for suspicious or newly registered domains. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) logs to monitor for abnormal process execution indicative of botnet agents. Access logs to detect unauthorized logins or increased activity from specific IP ranges or user accounts. |
| Key Indicators | Unusual outbound connection patterns, especially multiple outbound connections occurring simultaneously. Detection of communication with known botnet C2 servers or IPs that have been flagged in threat intelligence feeds. Sudden spikes in bandwidth usage or sustained network activity from internal hosts. Anomalous DNS queries, especially to domains with fast-flux or domain generation algorithms. Abnormal host discovery activities or network scanning behaviors. Increase in error messages from a single origin indicating potential brute force attempts. |
| Questions for Analysis | Are there identifiable patterns or commonalities in the traffic that could link multiple hosts to a botnet? Do log entries or alerts correlate with known botnet C2 addresses or domains? Has there been a recent increase in unsuccessful login attempts that might indicate credential stuffing attempts often associated with botnets? Are there any reports or IOCs that coincide with the detected suspicious activities? What are the potential business implications if a botnet compromise is confirmed? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate if there is confirmed communication with known malicious C2 infrastructure following correlation with threat intelligence. Escalate if the analysis indicates coordination across multiple hosts within the network showing suspect behavior. Escalate if there is a persistence in suspected botnet traffic, despite mitigation steps being applied. Escalate if potential indicators reveal that sensitive data could be at risk. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Review historical network logs to identify common characteristics or previous occurrences related to the detected patterns. Utilize threat intelligence platforms to gather more context around the flagged IPs or domains. Check for spikes in network traffic and resources on potential compromised endpoints. Verify the endpoints for any suspicious processes or services that could indicate active botnet agents. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Correlate the identified indicators with additional threat intelligence sources to ascertain the credibility of the threat. Conduct deeper forensic analysis on potentially compromised systems, looking for evidence such as unauthorized applications or anomalies in system logs. Evaluate whether the network segment hosting the suspect endpoints might be affected in a more widespread manner. Work closely with IT teams to ensure any identified malicious infrastructure is isolated. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Block identified malicious IP addresses and domains on firewalls and proxy servers to prevent further communication. Quarantine affected systems to avoid lateral movement and additional infections. Work with third-party services to analyze and enhance detection mechanisms around similar threat vectors. Conduct a through vulnerability assessment on the network to patch and mend potential points of ingress. Document findings in a post-incident report to strengthen preventive controls and response capabilities. |
