| Name | Compromise Infrastructure: Domains |
| Log Sources to Investigate | 1. DNS Logs: Monitor for anomalous domain registration activities, such as changes in WHOIS information or DNS record updates.<br>2. Email Activity Logs: Look for unusual access patterns to email accounts associated with domain registrars.<br>3. Cloud Service Logs: Examine logs from cloud platform services (e.g., AWS CloudTrail for Route53) for unauthorized access or changes.<br>4. Web Server Access Logs: Detect any suspicious requests to subdomains or unexpected subdomain creations.<br>5. SIEM Alerts: Track alerts that correlate domain-related changes or account compromises. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Unauthorized changes in domain registration details.<br>2. Unusual access to email accounts tied to domain management, such as multiple login attempts from different locations.<br>3. Creation of subdomains under non-existent or deprovisioned resources.<br>4. Increase in DNS queries for newly created or altered subdomains.<br>5. Notifications or alerts from domain registrars regarding account changes or transfers. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Has the domain registration information been altered recently? If so, who made the changes?<br>2. Are there any suspicious login attempts to email accounts associated with the domain?<br>3. Have any subdomains been created recently that do not have a clear business justification?<br>4. Is there any unusual or unauthorized access detected in cloud infrastructure services related to domains?<br>5. Are there any existing alerts about potential security threats associated with domain or subdomain takeovers? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if:<br>1. Unauthorized changes to domain records or registration details are confirmed.<br>2. There are unexplained login attempts or account access patterns resulting in changes to domain-related settings.<br>3. Evidence of subdomain takeover or shadowing with potential malicious intent is identified.<br>4. SIEM flags correlate with suspicious domain or subdomain behaviors and are validated. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Verify WHOIS information changes against known, authorized requests.<br>2. Cross-reference email access logs with known IPs or user activities.<br>3. Review recent DNS updates and cross-verify with a list of approved changes.<br>4. Temporarily monitor traffic to new or altered subdomains to assess potential misuse.<br>5. Check registrar and cloud account configurations for potential misconfigurations exploited during the incident. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Conduct deeper investigation into the origin of unauthorized domain changes, potentially involving digital forensic techniques.<br>2. Review email or cloud platform logs further for undetected suspicious activity during the time frame.<br>3. Validate and enrich incoming alerts with additional context, such as threat intelligence on domain hijacking TTPs.<br>4. Perform risk assessment to determine the potential impact of any subdomain takeovers.<br>5. Coordinate with IT operations to address any vulnerabilities or misconfigurations found. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Immediately rectify unauthorized domain changes through registrar communications.<br>2. Implement domain monitoring tools to detect future unauthorized changes promptly.<br>3. Isolate compromised email or cloud platform accounts and perform password changes or MFA enforcement.<br>4. Remove or neutralize rogue subdomains identified during investigation.<br>5. Collaborate with internal security teams and third-party incident response services to ensure adequate remediation and apply preventive measures post-incident. |
