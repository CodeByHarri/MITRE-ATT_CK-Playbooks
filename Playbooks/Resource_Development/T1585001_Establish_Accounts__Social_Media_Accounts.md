| Name | Establish Accounts: Social Media Accounts |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Monitor social media platforms (Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.) for account creation and interactions related to corporate or brand interests. Look into email accounts or communications for patterns resembling persona development activities, such as unusual requests or attempts to gain access to corporate resources. Additionally, examine web proxy logs for unusual traffic to social media sites, focusing on new account creations and interactions. |
| Key Indicators | Unusual activity involving interactions from newly created social media accounts, especially if they attempt to connect with multiple employees. Signs of social engineering attempts, such as requests for personal information or credentials. Multiple suspicious social media profiles connected to the same or similar email domains, usage of consistent personal data (like stock photos) across different profiles, or rapid account creation. |
| Questions for Analysis | Does the account involve suspicious behavior or interactions with employees? Are there repeat attempts from the same or similar profiles to connect with different employees? Is there any use of known suspicious keywords or request patterns indicating potential social engineering? Is the account profile filled out with generic, repetitive, or suspicious information? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate if the newly identified account shows attempts to connect with multiple employees or high-value targets, or if there are multiple instances of similar suspicious account creation across different social media platforms. Also, escalate if there is credible evidence of social engineering attempts, such as unusual access requests or policy violations. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Identify if the suspicious accounts have a pattern or a common link, such as using similar photos, bios, or content. Check the social media profiles for connections to known company associates or key stakeholders and verify their legitimacy. Look for feedback or responses from the targeted employees who might have interacted or been contacted by these suspicious accounts. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Perform deeper investigation into the account origins by analyzing metadata and related infrastructure, if possible. Correlate additional signals from endpoint detection systems or threat intelligence feeds. Engage with affected employees to understand interaction details and confirm suspicions of social engineering. Assess the risk profile and potential impact related to the specific targets or information sought. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Consider notifying the social media platform to report and possibly take down suspicious accounts. Educate employees on recognizing potential social engineering attempts and safe social media practices. If a breach is confirmed, initiate incident response measures to secure any compromised information and further monitor for misuse. Implement monitoring on corporate machines for unusual access patterns or data exfiltration attempts. Collaborate with legal or compliance teams if potential impersonation has impacted brand trust. |
