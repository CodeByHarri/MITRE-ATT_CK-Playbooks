| Name | Data Manipulation: Transmitted Data Manipulation |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Network traffic logs to identify unusual patterns or changes in data integrity during transmission. Monitor logs from data transmission protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, or other custom protocols. Access logs from systems involved in data processing and transfer, including middleware, data bus systems, and message queue logs. Examine endpoint detection and response (EDR) logs for alerts or anomalies indicating interception or manipulation of data. |
| Key Indicators | Unexpected checksum mismatches or data integrity errors during data transfers. Unusual network traffic patterns, such as data being redirected through unknown servers. Changes to data without corresponding authorized user activity. Presence of tools or scripts running that are capable of intercepting and altering data in transit. Communication to and from unfamiliar IP addresses during data transfer activities. |
| Questions for Analysis | Have there been recent changes to the systems or applications involved in data transmission? Are there any unauthorized or unexpected tools or processes running on relevant systems? Are there deviations from normal network paths or unexpected delays in data transmission? Is there evidence of data modification based on checksums or data integrity checks? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate if data integrity checks reveal unexplained inconsistencies. Escalate if unauthorized tools or processes related to data interception or modification are found on any system. Escalate if abnormal network traffic patterns suggest potential man-in-the-middle activities. Escalate if internal data is found to be altered upon receipt without corresponding legitimate changes. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Review system logs for unauthorized access attempts or privilege escalation. Verify the integrity of data files and consider user activity logging to determine any anomalies. Collaborate with network teams to trace unusual data paths and identify potential interception points. Conduct checks against security baseline configurations for unauthorized changes. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Investigate the scope of data manipulation to determine affected datasets and business processes. Perform deep packet inspection of network traffic to detect and analyze suspicious data alterations. Correlate findings with threat intelligence to identify known threats or adversary behaviors related to the TTP. Work with incident response teams to determine if additional monitoring needs to be deployed across the affected environment. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Isolate affected systems to prevent further data manipulation. Implement stricter network segmentation and access controls temporarily. Deploy additional endpoint protection measures to detect potential data interception tools. Conduct an integrity audit of all systems involved in data transmission processes. Coordinate with forensic teams to capture and analyze network traffic during the suspected period of compromise. |
