| Name | Obtain Capabilities: Exploits |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Monitor network traffic logs for unusual outbound connections to known exploit vendor sites or potential dark web marketplaces. Check endpoint monitoring tools for unusual file downloads or execution patterns that correspond to known exploit tool signatures. Review threat intelligence feeds for new exploit signatures and correlate with HTTP/S logs to identify downloads or attempted accesses. Analyze email logs for communication with third-parties known to supply exploits. |
| Key Indicators | Network connections to IPs or domains related to exploit distribution networks. Download and execution of exploit code or frameworks from third-party sources. Presence of known exploit signatures in file integrity monitoring or endpoint detection solutions. Spike in communications with external, unverified, or suspicious email addresses associated with exploit trading. |
| Questions for Analysis | Is there evidence of communication with known exploit distributors or marketplaces? Are there any unexplained inbound connections from systems typically associated with exploit development? Have similar incidents been flagged in the past, and what were the outcomes? Are multiple systems involved, indicating organized activity? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate if confirmed communication with exploit vendors or download of known exploit tools occurs. Also escalate if investigation uncovers any previous indicators of compromise linked to the same external addresses or entity. Escalate if there is tangible evidence of exploit deployment or attempted use within the environment. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Review the context around the suspicious network connections or file downloads to determine their origin. Check user activity logs to see if unauthorized individuals accessed sensitive systems or data. Validate whether the potentially malicious sites or IPs have a known threat reputation. Ensure that all identified actions are corroborated with other detection systems. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct deeper forensics on endpoints or systems identified as interacting with suspicious entities. Analyze network capture data for any additional signs of exploit-related activity. Cross-correlate with recent threat intelligence reports for any new capabilities adversaries may wield. Use advanced malware analysis tools to inspect downloaded files for exploit code. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Isolate affected machines to prevent further potential exfiltration or exploitation. Work with IT to update patches and address vulnerabilities that could be targeted by exploits. Implement IP filtering or domain blacklisting to block engagement with known exploit suppliers. Initiate security awareness training to update employees on risks tied to exploit procurement. Conduct a full sweep using updated signatures to detect any residual malicious software or exploit remnants. |
