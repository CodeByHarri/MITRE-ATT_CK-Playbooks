| Name | Web Service: Bidirectional Communication |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Start by investigating network traffic logs to identify unusual patterns of communication with known web services like Google, Twitter, or other social media platforms. Review proxy logs for any unexpected or previously unknown browser-based activity. Check endpoint logs for unexpected application or process executions that could be indicative of scripts or command-line utilities accessing web services. Analyze cloud service access logs if using cloud-based email or file storage like Google Workspace or Dropbox. |
| Key Indicators | Repeated outgoing requests to web service APIs from hosts not typically engaging in such activity. Abnormal increase in data transfer volumes to these services. Detection of HTTP requests embedding unknown commands or unusual HTTP headers. Uncommon user-agent strings in network traffic. Suspicious authentication attempts to web services using compromised credentials. |
| Questions for Analysis | Is there an identifiable pattern in web service communication that does not align with expected business operations? Are there anomalous URL structures or parameters in the outgoing requests? Do logs indicate any correlation between suspect traffic and known malicious IPs or domains? Is there unexpectedly high data exchange volume with web services? Is the suspicious activity originating from a critical system or a high-risk user account? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate if there are any correlations between web service communications and known indicators of compromise (IoCs), if there is a significant volume of data being exfiltrated, or if the communications are part of a larger pattern of suspicious activities identified within the network. Also, escalate if the attempts include critical systems or admin accounts. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Conduct initial triage by verifying IP reputation of the endpoints communicating with web services. Cross-reference outgoing requests with web service API documentation to identify legitimate versus potentially malicious requests. Dive into logs to isolate traffic patterns specific to the web services utilized. Determine if any newly installed applications or scripts correlate with suspicious network behavior. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Perform in-depth packet analysis to further unravel encoded or encrypted web service communications. Investigate endpoint and process monitoring data to trace any abnormal process activity. Utilize threat intelligence sources to supplement investigations for known tactics corresponding to the T1102.002 TTP. Correlate artifacts with recent threat actor campaigns known to adopt similar techniques. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Contain the threat by isolating affected hosts from the network. Implement firewall rules to block suspicious outgoing web service API access. Strengthen detection by deploying specific network monitoring dashboards focused on API and web service interactions. Forensic analysis of affected hosts to determine the breadth of the compromise. Engage with web service providers to understand any breach influence from their end and potentially gather more data. |
