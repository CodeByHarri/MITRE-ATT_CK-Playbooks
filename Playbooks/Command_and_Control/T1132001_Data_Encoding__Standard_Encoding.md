| Name | Data Encoding: Standard Encoding |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Network traffic logs should be monitored for unusual encoding patterns. Pay attention to web proxy logs, firewall logs, and intrusion detection/prevention system logs. Examples include detecting Base64-encoded data where plaintext is expected or unexpected Unicode use in HTTP headers. Also, consider examining DNS logs for encoded data in DNS queries or responses, and email gateway logs, as email attachments or body content may be encoded using MIME/Base64. |
| Key Indicators | Detection of Base64 strings in network data or application logs. Odd-length strings that may indicate encoding such as Hexadecimal. Excessive or anomalous usage of ASCII sequences that are not typical for the application. Unusually large or compressed payload sizes in network traffic might also indicate gzip compression. |
| Questions for Analysis | Is the encoded data present in outbound traffic? Does the encoded content correspond to known or benign applications, or does it break protocol norms? Are there any other concurrent suspicious activities associated with the host or network segment? Is the volume or frequency of encoded data unusual for the user or system? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if the encoded data is detected in critical systems, involves multiple outgoing network connections, or if the payload size is larger than typical usage. Escalation is also warranted if patterns suggest known threat actor tactics or if the encoded content cannot be correlated to legitimate business processes. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Decode the captured encoded data to understand its content. Utilize network analysis tools to determine the flow and origin/destination of the encoded data. Check hash values of decoded content against threat intelligence feeds. Verify if the encoded data could be attributed to newly implemented software or updates. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Perform a deeper investigation into decoded content and assess for presence of malicious code or scripts. Correlate findings with threat intelligence sources for indicators of compromise (IOCs). Review historical logs for any related patterns or previous incidents. Investigate the potential use of encoding mechanisms in other systems within the organization. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Apply network segmentation or isolation to systems showing persistent or extensive data encoding activities. Utilize host-based security tools to block encoded C2 communications. Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of affected systems to ensure no residual threat presence. Collaborate with threat intelligence teams to update detection systems with IOCs discovered during analysis. |
