| Log Sources to Investigate | Consider inspecting web proxy logs, packet capture data, firewall logs, and intrusion detection/prevention system logs. Look for unusual HTTP/S traffic patterns, such as odd User-Agent strings, uncommon HTTP methods (PUT, DELETE), or unexpected data flows in WebSocket traffic. Web server access logs containing unusual POST requests or traffic to/from suspicious or newly registered domains should also be reviewed. |
| Key Indicators | Look for HTTP/S traffic with irregularities such as high-frequency connections to specific IPs or domains, large outbound data transfers via POST, anomalous HTTP methods, encrypted payloads in standard HTTP headers, and significant data transfers in WebSocket communications. Suspicious domain names, especially newly registered ones, and unusual User-Agent strings mimicking common browsers should also be considered. Unexpected HTTP requests during off-hours could be another indicator. |
| Questions for Analysis | Is the observed HTTP/S traffic pattern typical for the associated user or system? Are the involved domains or IPs known and reputable, or are they newly registered or flagged as malicious? Does the User-Agent string appear legitimate, or does it deviate from expected patterns for the user/system? Are there anomalous HTTP methods being utilized that are not typical for regular web traffic? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate if the HTTP/S traffic involves communication with known malicious infrastructure, such as blacklisted IPs/domains, or if there are strong indicators like irregular User-Agent strings, use of unknown HTTP methods, and large unexpected data transfers. Additionally, escalate if corroborating evidence, like triggered IDS/IPS alerts, is found. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify the legitimacy of involved IPs/domains with threat intelligence sources. Check historical traffic patterns for the involved user/system to establish a baseline of normal behavior. Cross-reference current activity against known malicious indicators. Investigate user or system activity to identify any anomalies preceding or following the suspect traffic. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Perform deeper packet inspection to understand the content of HTTP/S traffic, focusing on payload analysis and header inspection. Analyze the timing, frequency, and size of data exchanges to identify suspicious patterns. Cross-verify with threat intelligence platforms for any active threat campaigns involving the observed indicators. Conduct endpoint analysis for potential compromise signs. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Block or sinkhole identified malicious IPs/domains to prevent further communication. Quarantine affected hosts for detailed forensic investigation, including memory and disk analysis. Engage with network personnel to implement network segmentation or additional monitoring for early detection of any lateral movement attempts. Document findings, assess the scope of the incident, and prepare for potential remediation steps. |
