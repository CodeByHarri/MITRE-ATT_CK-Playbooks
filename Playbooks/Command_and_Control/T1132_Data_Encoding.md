| Name | Data Encoding |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Network traffic logs (e.g., packet capture logs), Proxy logs, Web server access logs, Mail server logs. These logs can show raw data transfers where unusual encoding systems are employed. Look for entries showing encoded data patterns like Base64 or unusual MIME types in HTTP requests/responses. |
| Key Indicators | Presence of data encodings such as Base64, MIME in unexpected fields or data transfers, Unusually high volume of encoded data, Non-standard port usage with encoded transfers, Anomalies in standard protocol adherence due to data encoding. |
| Questions for Analysis | Is the data encoding consistent with normal application behaviors? Are the ports or protocols associated with encoded data usage typical for organizational traffic? Are there specific users or systems frequently associated with the encoded data flow? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate if the encoded data is being transferred with unexpected ports or protocols, if data encoding seems out of character for regular operations, or if the same encoding patterns appear across multiple systems or users suddenly. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Check historical logs for patterns of similar encoding usage, Cross-reference unusual encodings with threat intelligence for known malicious patterns, Verify the context of the encoded data transfersâ€”such as time, day, and destination to understand if this correlates with known attacks or breaches. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Perform deeper packet analysis to determine the true nature and intent of the encoded content, Investigate associated systems for any indicators of compromise (IoCs) or unauthorized changes, Correlate findings with additional threat intelligence or alert on new signatures for further monitoring. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Isolate affected systems from the network to prevent data exfiltration or further compromise, Modify firewall rules to block suspicious encoding transfers, Work with network engineering to implement more robust detection mechanisms for encoded C2 traffic, Conduct a full forensic investigation on isolated systems to assess impact and remediate as needed. |
