| Name | Content Injection |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Network traffic logs, Web proxy logs, DNS query logs, Firewall logs, HTTP(S) traffic logs related to user activity. Examples include inspecting logs from tools such as Wireshark, Zeek, or Splunk for unusual content injection activities, especially observing the origin of incoming data and any deviations from known server addresses. |
| Key Indicators | Increased volume of HTTP(S) requests with unexpected payloads, anomalous or altered traffic patterns, presence of unusual domains in DNS logs, discrepancies between client-side and server-side content, existence of unexpected JavaScript or HTML in web responses, repeated 3xx HTTP status codes indicating redirection to malicious sites. |
| Questions for Analysis | Are there any unusual spikes or anomalies in user network activity? Is there evidence of simultaneous legitimate and illegitimate responses arriving from supposed authoritative servers? Are there repeated DNS requests suggesting exfiltration or beaconing? Do logs show signs of tampering or abnormalities in data packets that could indicate content injection? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if the analysis identifies consistent anomalous traffic patterns suggestive of man-on-the-side or content injection threats, confirms the presence of unexpected payloads or content within maintained network or system logs, or if the activities persist beyond expected or explainable deviations. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Review the frequency and source of HTTP requests and related responses, corollate timestamps of suspicious activity with user-reported anomalies, verify the integrity and authenticity of digital certificates, filter out known good traffic to isolate potentially malicious patterns. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Perform deep packet inspection to identify any malicious payloads, correlate findings with threat intelligence feeds, execute historical log comparisons for baselining and identifying deviations, conduct endpoint inspections to check for anomalies post payload delivery, and check files for headers or other forensic markers of content injection. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Block identified malicious IPs and domains at firewall or proxy levels, update IDS/IPS signatures based on findings, inform affected users and enforce multi-factor authentication for compromised accounts or systems, retain forensic evidence, and if necessary, engage with ISP or upstream service providers for shared-interception issues. |
