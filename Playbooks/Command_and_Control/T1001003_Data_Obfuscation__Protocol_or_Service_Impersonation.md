| Log Sources to Investigate | Network traffic logs, such as those generated by a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) or a Web Proxy, are critical. Look for unusual patterns in traffic volume or destinations in network flow data. SSL/TLS inspection logs should be reviewed to detect any anomalies in certificate usage or handshake processes. DNS logs should be analyzed to identify possible command and control (C2) domains masquerading as legitimate services. |
| Key Indicators | Key indicators include anomalous SSL/TLS certificates, unusual HTTP header manipulations, traffic directed to high-risk IP addresses masquerading as legitimate services, and irregular usage patterns of standard ports (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS). An increase in DNS queries for non-existent or poorly rated domains, along with unrecognized user-agent strings mimicking popular software, may also indicate suspicious activity. |
| Questions for Analysis | What is the destination IP address or domain of the suspicious traffic, and is it associated with any known threat actor or suspicious activity? Are there any discrepancies in expected versus observed traffic patterns over standard ports (e.g., HTTPS on port 443)? Does the SSL certificate information match the purported service provider, or are there any irregularities such as unknown issuers or mismatched domain names? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if any IP addresses or domains involved are flagged by threat intelligence sources as malicious. Also, escalate if anomalies are found in SSL/TLS certificates that do not match known fingerprints for legitimate services or if there are significant deviations from expected network traffic baselines indicative of potential data exfiltration or C2 activity. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Perform a deeper inspection of SSL/TLS certificates associated with the traffic, identifying mismatches or discrepancies. Review DNS query patterns for any deviations or patterns suggestive of domain fronting. Cross-reference observed IP addresses and domains against threat intelligence feeds to further assess risk. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct packet-level analysis to decode suspicious traffic and verify the nature of the communication. Investigate potential connections to known C2 infrastructure using threat intelligence platforms. Collaborate with network engineers to trace the flow and potential entry point of the traffic, leveraging resources such as SIEM for correlation. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Isolate affected systems from the network to prevent potential data exfiltration. Block any malicious IP addresses or domains identified during the investigation. Strengthen SSL/TLS inspection capabilities to detect and prevent protocol impersonation attempts. Deploy additional monitoring on endpoints to detect any similar behaviors. If applicable, report the incident to appropriate authorities and update threat intelligence sources with any newly discovered indicators of compromise (IOCs). |
