| Name | Archive Collected Data: Archive via Utility |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Review system and security event logs for activity related to file compression and encryption utilities. Specific logs include: <br>- Application logs for any entries related to the execution of compression utilities like '7-Zip', 'WinRAR', 'WinZip', 'tar', 'zip', 'makecab', or 'diantz'.<br>- Windows Security logs (Event ID 4688) for process creation events involving execution of archiving utilities.<br>- PowerShell logs (Event ID 4104) if scripts were used for compressing or encrypting data.<br>- Sysmon logs for detailed process creation and file events involving archiving utilities.<br>- Network logs to detect unusual outbound traffic potentially related to data exfiltration using these packaged files. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Unusual execution of archiving utilities such as '7-Zip', 'WinRAR', 'tar', 'makecab', 'diantz', or 'certutil'.<br>2. Scripts or command-line executions involving archiving commands with parameters indicating compression or encryption.<br>3. Unexpected .zip, .rar, .7z, or .cab file creation in directories known for data storage or containing sensitive information.<br>4. Base64 encoded files observed in unusual directories or transmitted over the network.<br>5. Significant spikes in outbound traffic following file archiving, potentially pointing to exfiltration attempts. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Is there a known legitimate business reason for the use of these archiving tools or specific utilities on the affected system?<br>2. Are the compressed or encrypted files located in directories that typically store sensitive data?<br>3. Was there a pattern of archiving followed by data being sent outbound that may indicate exfiltration?<br>4. Are these activities consistent with the known behavior of the user or the system involved? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if: <br>- There is no legitimate reason for the use of these utilities by the user or on the affected system.<br>- The user does not have administrative privileges or a history of using such utilities.<br>- There is evidence of significant shadow IT activity involving file compression or encryption utilities.<br>- There are observed patterns of outbound data transfer following the use of these utilities suggesting potential data exfiltration. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Verify the legitimacy of the process and user account associated with utility execution.<br>2. Cross-reference with known good configurations or baselines for expected utility usage.<br>3. Identify and alert on any anomalies in file creation or network traffic post-utility execution.<br>4. Document all relevant details and prepare a comprehensive report for further analysis if needed. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Conduct a deeper investigation into timeline events surrounding the use of utilities.<br>2. Analyze communication patterns and end connections related to outbound traffic.<br>3. Perform an integrity check on the system for any signs of secondary impact or malware.<br>4. Correlate with threat intelligence to check for any known IoCs or tactics associated with observed behaviors. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent potential data loss.<br>2. Quarantine any suspicious files or archiving utilities that were identified during analysis.<br>3. Conduct a full forensic analysis of the system to determine how the utility was executed and the scope of data involved.<br>4. Implement monitoring for additional behavior indicative of data staging or exfiltration attempts.<br>5. Review and strengthen DLP systems to detect and prevent unauthorized data transfers in the future. |
