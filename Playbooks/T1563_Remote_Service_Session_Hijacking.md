| Name | Remote Service Session Hijacking |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate RDP, SSH, and Telnet logs for abnormal login behaviors. Examples include: sudden user session handovers, session continuity logs that show an unexpected switch of IP addresses or geographical location, and session hijacking error messages. Network traffic logs should be reviewed to detect unusual connection patterns on ports typically associated with remote services (e.g., 3389 for RDP, 22 for SSH, and 23 for Telnet). Additionally, security event logs or SIEM alerts that track logins and session activity should be analyzed for context around the user and machine identity involved in the session. |
| Key Indicators | Key indicators include: a session takeover without a typical login/logoff footprint, rapid or irregular geographic changes in source IP address during a session, discrepancies in user and device authentication timestamps, and sudden access during non-business hours. Anomalies in user behavior shortly following session announcements are potential indicators of hijacking as well. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Was there any anomaly in user IP address or location noted in the session logs?<br>2. Is there any recorded login event without a corresponding logoff event from the same IP?<br>3. Were there any unusual data transfer or commands executed during this session?<br>4. Are there any other alerts or unusual activities associated with this user or endpoint?<br>5. Are legitimate users reporting unexpected disconnections or session behavior? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalation to Tier 2 is warranted if: there are confirmed logins without logoffs, followed by continued activity from abnormal IP or geographic locations; there are suspicious commands or large data transfers during the suspected hijacked session; or any corroborating indicators from other security alerts or user reports of session hijacking. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Cross-reference the log source data with known trusted IP addresses to identify potential mismatches. <br>2. Verify session continuity and look for gaps in login/logoff activities.<br>3. Check for alerts from endpoint detection systems for the user session in question.<br>4. Use SIEM tools to correlate suspicious behaviors with historical data for pattern verification. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Conduct a thorough investigation of the user's activity footprint and compare it against historical behavior benchmarks.<br>2. Use network traffic analysis tools to detect anomalies during the suspected hijacked session timeline.<br>3. Collaborate with threat intelligence teams to check for similar TTP patterns.<br>4. Liaise with IT support to verify whether there have been any recent changes to user account permissions or remote service configurations. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Immediately isolate the endpoint if session hijacking is confirmed.<br>2. Instruct IT to reset credentials and invalidate all existing remote sessions for the affected account.<br>3. Conduct a post-incident forensic analysis to identify root causes and points of entry.<br>4. Implement additional security measures, such as multi-factor authentication, to secure remote service accesses.<br>5. Review and update security policies and training regarding remote session security for all employees. |
