| Name | Obfuscated Files or Information: Command Obfuscation |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Examine logs from command-line auditing tools such as Sysmon (Event ID 1 for process creation), PowerShell logs (especially Script Block Logging), and Windows Security Event Logs (Event ID 4688 for process creation). Network monitoring tools such as Zeek or Suricata can be helpful if command or script information is sent over the network. Check logs from endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions for identifying obfuscation patterns. Example log entries to inspect include unusual process names or command lines, environment variables accessing unfamiliar external services, and unexpected network connections. |
| Key Indicators | Look for evidence of command obfuscation techniques, such as excessive use of escape characters (^, +, $, %), unusual spacing, base64 or URL encoding in commands, unusual directory traversal strings, and string manipulation patterns (`'Wor'+’d.Application’`). Frequent invocation of scripts or commands with non-standard arguments, and use of tools like Invoke-Obfuscation or Invoke-DOSfuscation are also key indicators. |
| Questions for Analysis | Does the command or script appear to be normal business activity? Is there legitimate use of obfuscation for proprietary reasons? Are there any known associations with malicious tools (e.g., Invoke-Obfuscation)? Are similar obfuscation patterns detected across multiple hosts which could indicate a widespread campaign? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate if obfuscation is observed in critical systems or by an account not typically associated with scripting activities. Also, escalate if detection correlates with IOCs from known threat activity or if there are signs of lateral movement or data exfiltration. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify the source of the detected obfuscated command to identify if it was started by a legitimate user or process. Cross-reference the detection with known threat intelligence to see if it matches any known TTPs. Check for any correlated alerts or other suspicious activities occurring around the same timeframe on the involved host. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Perform a deeper dive into any obfuscated commands to determine their intended function using de-obfuscation scripts or manual analysis. Investigate the originating and target systems for signs of compromise using host-based forensic tools. Gather intelligence on the scope and intent of the activity by analyzing the presence of similar TTPs across the environment. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | If malicious activity is confirmed, isolate the impacted systems to prevent further propagation. Review and clean up any unauthorized accounts or scripts and update defensive measures to prevent recurrence. Conduct a thorough post-incident analysis to identify root cause and document findings for lessons learned, ensuring detection capabilities are enhanced to prevent future occurrences. |
