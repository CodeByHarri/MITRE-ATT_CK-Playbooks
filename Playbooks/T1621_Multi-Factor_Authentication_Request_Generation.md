| Name | Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation |
| Log Sources to Investigate | 1. Authentication logs from MFA services (e.g., Duo, Microsoft Authenticator, Okta) to review patterns of login attempts and MFA requests.<br>2. Centralized logging systems (e.g., SIEM) for correlated alerts involving failed logins and subsequent MFA requests.<br>3. Email and SMS logs if the MFA requests are being sent through these channels to detect anomalous volumes or patterns. 4. Endpoint detection logs to identify any suspicious activities or abnormal behavior on devices connected to the same accounts. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Unusually high number of MFA requests sent to a user within a short timeframe.<br>2. Spike in failed authentication attempts followed by eventual successful login.<br>3. Geographic anomalies where login attempts originate from different regions or countries. 4. Multiple MFA requests that coincide with off-hours based on the user's normal working hours. 5. User reports of unsolicited and repeated MFA requests or complaints of being 'MFA bombed'. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Has there been an unusual number of MFA requests for this account?<br>2. Are the login attempts coming from unfamiliar or suspicious IP addresses or geographic locations?<br>3. Is there a pattern of login attempts that align with common 'MFA fatigue' tactics? 4. Has the user reported any unsolicited MFA requests? 5. Are there multiple accounts exhibiting similar suspicious activity patterns? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if: 1. There is a confirmation of unusual volume of MFA requests in correlation with failed logins.<br>2. Login attempts are associated with suspicious IP addresses or regions known for malicious activity.<br>3. There are multiple users affected, indicating a possibly broader attack. 4. Any user successfully authenticated following repeated failed attempts and MFA requests without acknowledging their login attempt. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Verify the source of MFA request generation and its timing.<br>2. Check for similar patterns in other user accounts.<br>3. Communicate with the affected user(s) to confirm if the MFA requests were expected or unsolicited. 4. Review the integrity of user account settings to ensure MFA configurations haven't been tampered. 5. Conduct a preliminary check of network logs to gather information about IP addresses attempting logins. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Perform deep analysis of the origin and nature of the MFA requests, correlating with network and SIEM logs.<br>2. Explore IP addresses for reputation and history in threat intelligence databases.<br>3. Monitor for additional indicators of compromise in related systems or accounts. 4. Coordinate with affected users to change credentials and enable additional security controls if necessary. 5. Determine if broader organizational measures need to be implemented to mitigate the attack vector. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Immediately lock or temporarily disable affected accounts if compromise is confirmed.<br>2. Reset MFA mechanisms and enforce a credential change for affected accounts.<br>3. Deploy additional security measures such as login alerts and additional verification steps. 4. Conduct a thorough audit of the affected accounts and devices for potential backdoors or secondary infection vectors. 5. Review and update MFA policies and self-service password reset protocols to minimize the risk of similar attacks. |
