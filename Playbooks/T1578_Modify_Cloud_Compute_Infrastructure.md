| Name | Modify Cloud Compute Infrastructure |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Examine cloud provider logs such as AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Logs, or Google Cloud Audit Logs to identify changes made to compute infrastructure. Include logs pertaining to creation, modification, or deletion of virtual machines, snapshots, or compute instances. Cloud API logs can provide insights into who performed the operation and when. Additionally, monitor IAM role changes or policy modifications, which may indicate privilege escalation attempts. |
| Key Indicators | Look for sudden creation or deletion of VMs or compute instances that do not align with expected activity. Changes to existing snapshots, especially those leading to data exfiltration or swap with malicious images, are key indicators. Unusual API calls from unfamiliar IP addresses or at abnormal times could signify unauthorized access. Changes to IAM roles or permissions providing extended access to compute services should be scrutinized. |
| Questions for Analysis | Does the timing of the modification align with known maintenance windows or change management events? Have modifications been performed using IAM roles or access keys recently created or modified? Are there any associated user accounts with recent changes in access patterns or login anomalies? Are these actions coming from known IP addresses or regions? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if modifications appear unrelated to expected activities or change management procedures, if unusual access patterns are discovered (e.g., geographic anomalies or access from unrecognized IPs), or if there are indications of data exfiltration through snapshots or VMs. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify the user or service account performing the modifications and check their recent activity. Correlate the timeline of changes with any scheduled maintenance or deployment activities. Analyze if the changes could potentially expose confidential data or disrupt operations. Cross-reference modifications with known threat patterns or indicators of compromise. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Perform a deeper investigation into the originating IP addresses and correlate with other suspicious activities ongoing in the environment. Check for any additional compromised credentials or lateral movement within the cloud environment. Conduct a thorough review of access logs for successful and failed login attempts linked to the involved accounts. Determine if snapshots have been exported or if data has potentially been exfiltrated. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Revoke or suspend any unusual cloud credentials or access roles. Implement IAM policy restrictions to limit permissions for affected or suspicious accounts. Consider isolating compromised VMs or instances and conduct forensic imaging to understand the adversary's actions. After remediation, enhance monitoring and update incident response procedures to cover similar TTPs. Notify relevant stakeholders and update them on containment measures and next steps. |
