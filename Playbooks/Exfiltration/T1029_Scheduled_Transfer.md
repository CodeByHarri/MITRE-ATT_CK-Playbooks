| Name | Scheduled Transfer |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate scheduler logs such as Cron Jobs on Unix/Linux systems, Task Scheduler logs on Windows, and any custom scripts used within the organization. Look into network traffic logs to identify patterns or anomalies reflective of scheduled activities, such as firewall logs, proxy logs, and data transfer logs. Examine data from DLP (Data Loss Prevention) systems to see if exfiltration attempts were flagged. Additionally, check endpoint monitoring logs and egress traffic patterns for any scheduled data transfer activities. |
| Key Indicators | Unusual or newly configured scheduled tasks, especially those set outside normal maintenance windows. High volume of data transfer at off-hours or times when normal business operations are limited. Scheduled tasks associated with non-standard or suspicious scripts executing data transfer commands. Network traffic anomalies indicating data packets sent to known exfiltration domains, or use of alternative protocols and non-standard ports at regular intervals. |
| Questions for Analysis | Are there any scheduled tasks or jobs configured recently that coincide with suspected data transfer activities? Does the destination IP or domain of the transferred data align with known or suspected exfiltration endpoints? Are there any unauthorized changes in the configuration of critical systems that enable scheduled data transfers? Is there a legitimate business need for data transfers scheduled at the identified times? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate if the scheduled tasks are linked to suspicious domains, IPs, or involve significant data volume transfers. Escalate when there is no business justification or if attempts were made to obfuscate the exfiltration paths. Also escalate when intrusion detection systems or DLP tools flag the transfer as a policy violation or if it aligns with known threat actor behaviors. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify the legitimacy of scheduled tasks by cross-referencing with change management records. Check the creation and modification dates of tasks or scripts for alignment with any suspicious activities. Scan for any unauthorized access attempts relating to job creation or modification. Correlate the task execution times with network flow patterns to identify potential overlaps with anomalies. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct a deep dive into network flow analysis for pattern recognition over the period in question. Investigate the origin and destination of scheduled data transfers for any association with known malicious infrastructure. Utilize threat intelligence feeds to assess if the transferred data's destination matches any known malicious infrastructure or threat actor signatures. Analyze script content executed by scheduled tasks for possible reverse engineering implications or malicious intent. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Disable and remove any unauthorized scheduled tasks immediately. Block identified malicious IPs or domains in firewall and endpoint settings. Conduct a full compromise assessment on systems that scheduled the exfiltration tasks. Enhance monitoring on affected systems for any further anomalies. If legitimate business operations are affected, consult with relevant stakeholders for remediation and reporting. Prepare a detailed report on the way data was scheduled for exfiltration, identifying potential security policy gaps, and recommend strengthening security controls. |
