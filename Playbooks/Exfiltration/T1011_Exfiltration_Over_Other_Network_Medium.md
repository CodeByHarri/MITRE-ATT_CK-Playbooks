| Name | Exfiltration Over Other Network Medium |
| Log Sources to Investigate | 1. Wireless network traffic logs: Monitor for unusual uplink traffic patterns, especially during odd hours.<br>2. Bluetooth device connection logs: Identify unexpected or unauthorized Bluetooth device connections to endpoints.<br>3. Cellular network logs: Check for spikes in data usage or unusual cellular connections on enterprise devices. 4. Modem and RF transmission logs: Detect any unauthorized modem or RF transmissions from within enterprise premises. Examples include SIEM logs capturing network anomalies, endpoint logs from network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), and connection logs from endpoint management solutions. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Abnormal traffic patterns on secondary network interfaces (e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth).<br>2. Detection of unauthorized RF or Bluetooth signals originating from sensitive areas.<br>3. Increased data usage on cellular plans for enterprise devices not typically using mobile data for business operations. 4. Alerts triggered by devices simultaneously connected to different network mediums, which is not normally allowed by policy. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Does the device typically use this secondary network medium?<br>2. Is the volume of data being transferred typical for this device?<br>3. Are there known legitimate reasons for this secondary network medium usage? 4. Are there any recent changes to network configurations or policies that could explain this behavior? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if: 1. The source of the exfiltration is a high-value asset or contains critical data.<br>2. There is no known legitimate reason for the device to use a secondary network medium.<br>3. The exfiltration activity coincides with known threat actor TTPs or ongoing threat campaigns. 4. Multiple devices exhibit similar exfiltration patterns, indicating a potential coordinated attack. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Verify and document all connections and data transfers on the suspect network mediums.<br>2. Cross-reference device activity with authorized network usage policies.<br>3. Analyze recent configuration changes or patches applied to endpoints. 4. Review historical logs for similar activity indicating a pattern. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Correlate findings with threat intelligence sources to identify any known threat actors or malware families.<br>2. Perform deep packet analysis of secondary network transmissions to identify data characteristics or potential data types exfiltrated.<br>3. Conduct endpoint security assessments to determine if malware facilitated the exfiltration. 4. Coordinate with network teams to track and isolate suspect network mediums from enterprise networks. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Disable secondary network mediums on affected devices until a thorough investigation is complete.<br>2. Gather full forensic images of suspect devices for deeper analysis.<br>3. Implement additional monitoring and alerting for secondary network usage. 4. Review and update network security policies to ensure comprehensive coverage over all potential exfiltration paths. 5. Notify the incident response team to prepare for potential wider compromise if evidence suggests coordinated attacks. |
