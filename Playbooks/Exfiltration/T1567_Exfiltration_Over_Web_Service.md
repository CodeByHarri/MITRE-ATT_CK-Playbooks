| Name | Exfiltration Over Web Service |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate the following log sources to identify potential exfiltration over web services: <br>1. Web Proxy Logs: Monitor for unusual data transfers to known web service domains. Examples include large files or significant bandwidth usage to Dropbox, Google Drive, etc. <br>2. Network Firewall Logs: Look for outbound traffic patterns to web services, especially those using ports 80, 443, that show increased volume or unexpected destinations. <br>3. Host-based Web and Application Logs: Check for applications or processes accessing external web services uncharacteristically. <br>4. SSL/TLS inspection logs: Highlight anomaly in encrypted data streams to web services. |
| Key Indicators | Key indicators of exfiltration over web service may include: <br>1. Large, unexpected data file uploads to cloud storage services like Dropbox, OneDrive, or Google Drive. <br>2. Unusual outbound traffic to web service domains during non-business hours or from systems that do not usually access those services. <br>3. Anomalies in encrypted traffic such as persistent SSL/TLS sessions with higher than typical bandwidth utilization. <br>4. Changes in user behavior, such as accessing new web applications that provide file storage or transfer capabilities unexpectedly. |
| Questions for Analysis | Tier 1 analysts should consider these questions: <br>1. Is there a pattern of increased data transfer volume to specific web services? <br>2. Are there any known users or business justifications for accessing these web services? <br>3. Does the access pattern correspond with typical user behavior or working hours? <br>4. Are there any newly installed applications or browser extensions that could account for the traffic? |
| Decision for Escalation | Criteria for escalation to Tier 2 should include: <br>1. Lack of a legitimate business reason for the traffic pattern identified. <br>2. Data exfiltration appears to involve sensitive or classified information. <br>3. The activity involves a privileged account or critical system. <br>4. Confirmed detection of exfiltration tools or scripts executing on the host system. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Additional steps for L1 analysts include: <br>1. Verify the source and destination of the traffic in question, ensuring it matches known legitimate endpoints. <br>2. Cross-reference the user or system initiating the traffic with HR or asset management systems for context. <br>3. Document and query any scripts or software on the endpoint initiating unexpected traffic. <br>4. Investigate any associated user account activity for anomalies or login patterns. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Tier 2 analysts should: <br>1. Conduct a deeper audit of the network traffic and affected systems, possibly using packet capture tools to further characterize the data being exfiltrated. <br>2. Review historical data patterns and correlate with threat intelligence on known adversary tactics involving similar methods. <br>3. Engage with threat hunting teams to look for similar patterns across the network or other endpoints. <br>4. Work with IT to perform vulnerability assessment on implicated systems to identify potential exploitation points. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | To contain and further analyze the threat: <br>1. Temporarily block or limit access to suspicious web services from the impacted system(s). <br>2. Isolate the affected host to prevent further unauthorized data egress. <br>3. Notify data protection officers if sensitive data types are involved. <br>4. Conduct a full malware scan and forensic examination of the system to identify any persistence mechanisms or additional threats. <br>5. Provide detailed incident reports for review by security leadership and stakeholders for policy adjustments or remedial actions. |
