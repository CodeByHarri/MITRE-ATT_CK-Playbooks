| Name | Exfiltration Over Other Network Medium: Exfiltration Over Bluetooth |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate Bluetooth activity logs, which might be captured by endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems, mobile device management (MDM) solutions, or specific Bluetooth monitoring tools. Additionally, check system and application logs for entries related to Bluetooth connections and data transfers. Network monitoring tools may have visibility over Bluetooth signals if they support wireless monitoring. Examples include:<br>- EDR logs showing Bluetooth connection requests or data transfer initiation<br>- System logs (e.g., Windows Event Logs) capturing Bluetooth pairing events or disconnections<br>- MDM logs detailing actions taken on mobile devices in relation to Bluetooth <br>- Wireless IDS/IPS logs capturing unusual Bluetooth RF signals or anomalies. |
| Key Indicators | Look for unusual or unauthorized Bluetooth pairing events, especially those that occur outside business hours or in atypical locations. Monitor data transfer logs for abnormal volumes of data being sent over Bluetooth. Indicators include:<br>- Pairing with unknown or newly seen devices<br>- High volume data transfers via Bluetooth<br>- Repeated connection attempts or connections to multiple devices within a short period<br>- Abnormal device discovery events indicating scanning for devices. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Is there evidence of unauthorized or unusual Bluetooth device pairings?<br>2. Are there data transfers over Bluetooth that deviate from normal operational baselines?<br>3. Was the Bluetooth data transfer initiated by a user or a system process without clear justification?<br>4. Are there any security policy violations regarding Bluetooth usage?<br>5. Is there a history of similar suspicious activities from the involved device? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if:<br>- There is confirmation of unauthorized data transfer to an unknown device.<br>- Alerting indicates multiple suspicious activities stemming from the same endpoint.<br>- Contextual data suggests potential data exfiltration attempts.<br>- Evidence shows a device was compromised or breached.<br>- Significant or sensitive data appears to have been accessed or transferred. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Verify whether the Bluetooth connection and data transfer align with known business activities.<br>2. Check if there is a legitimate business need for Bluetooth usage on the device.<br>3. Compare current device behavior with historical activity logs for anomalies.<br>4. Gather and review user activity surrounding the time of the Bluetooth event.<br>5. Assess whether the device has existing security controls or policies restricting Bluetooth use. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Perform a deeper forensic analysis of the involved device(s) to identify indicators of compromise.<br>2. Cross-reference the involved Bluetooth device MAC addresses with internal asset inventories to identify potential rogue devices.<br>3. Coordinate with IT for physical inspection if suspicious devices are involved in the connection.<br>4. Examine data leaving the device to ensure no sensitive information was transferred.<br>5. Implement network segmentation for similar devices to contain the risk of exfiltration. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Isolate the affected endpoint to prevent further unauthorized data transfer.<br>2. Review and reinforce Bluetooth security policies, disabling Bluetooth for critical devices if necessary.<br>3. Conduct a security awareness briefing for employees on safe Bluetooth practices.<br>4. Analyze broader network activity for signs of compromise, using threat hunting to check for lateral movement or additional attacker footholds.<br>5. Collaborate with legal and compliance teams if sensitive data was involved, initiating incident response procedures where applicable. |
