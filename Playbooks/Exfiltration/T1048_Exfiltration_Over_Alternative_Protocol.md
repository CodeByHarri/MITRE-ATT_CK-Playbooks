| Name | Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Network traffic logs from firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to identify unusual outbound connections. Proxy logs for HTTP/S, FTP, or other alternative protocol activity that deviates from normal usage patterns. DNS logs to detect large volumes of unusual DNS queries potentially indicative of data exfiltration. File access logs from DLP solutions that might capture sensitive data being accessed or transferred. Endpoint logs including process creation events to detect the use of tools like curl, Net commands, or scripts initiating these transfers. |
| Key Indicators | Unusual traffic to external IP addresses on non-standard ports. Elevated outbound data volume over alternative protocols like FTP, SMTP, or HTTP/S that is not typical for the organization. Use of command-line tools such as curl or wget on macOS/Linux systems initiating network connections to external addresses. Unusual DNS queries that do not align with typical patterns or high frequency DNS requests. Sudden changes in typical data access patterns, such as a user account accessing large volumes of data or not typically accessed data. |
| Questions for Analysis | Is the traffic proceeding over an unusual protocol for this particular user or system? Is the outbound data volume suspiciously high compared to the normal operation? Are there any associated anomalies or alerts linked to the same user or system recently? Are the destination IP addresses known or associated with legitimate business partners? Has the user been accessing unusual files or file types prior to the exfiltration event? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if the detected activity involves a high volume of data, uses unusual protocols, or if the destination IP is flagged as unknown or suspicious. Additionally, escalate if there are accompanying suspicious activities like multiple failed login attempts or simultaneous connections from different geolocations. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Review the logs for any other recent anomalous activities involving the same asset or account. Correlate with DLP logs to check for any accessed or transferred sensitive information. Check for any user account anomalies in identity management logs. Verify if there's any legitimate business justification for the exfiltration observed. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Perform deeper network analysis using packet captures to inspect the content of the traffic. Confirm the ownership and legitimacy of the destination IP addresses. Cross-reference with threat intelligence databases for any signs of known malicious actors. Evaluate the context of the exfiltration within broader organizational activities to determine if it links with any current investigations. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Isolate the affected system to prevent further potential data loss. Engage with affected departments to limit access to the compromised account or resource. Modify firewall and security group rules temporarily to block communication with suspicious destinations. Conduct a thorough forensic investigation of the compromised asset to gather more information and prevent future incidents. Work with IT to track the removal of any unauthorized software or tools used for exfiltration. |
