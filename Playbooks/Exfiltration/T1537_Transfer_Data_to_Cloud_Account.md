| Name | Transfer Data to Cloud Account |
| Log Sources to Investigate | 1. Cloud Service Provider Logs: Audit logs from AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Logs, or GCP Audit Logs to track actions involving data transfers and resource modifications.<br>2. Cloud Storage Access Logs: Logs from AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or GCP Cloud Storage to monitor data access and transfer activities.<br>3. Network Traffic Logs: Virtual network logs or flow logs to detect unusual internal data transfer patterns.<br>4. Identity and Access Management (IAM) Logs: Look for unauthorized changes to roles or permissions that could facilitate data transfers.<br>5. Shared Link Auditing: Logs or monitoring of shared file links, particularly focusing on new shared access signature (SAS) URIs or anonymous sharing links. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Unusual Data Transfer Patterns: High-volume data transfers within the cloud environment, particularly if directed to external or new accounts. <br>2. Creation of Backup Snapshots: Sudden or unauthorized creation of backups or snapshots of cloud instances.<br>3. New Sharing Links: Creation of new file sharing links or SAS URIs, especially those that grant broad access.<br>4. Changes in IAM Permissions: New or modified IAM roles granting broad access to data or allowing data export.<br>5. Access Patterns: Data access or transfer actions originating from unusual IPs or accounts. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Are there known legitimate business processes that could justify the observed data transfers?<br>2. Do the accounts involved in the data transfer match any known adversary profiles?<br>3. Have there been recent changes to IAM roles or permissions that correlate with the detected activity?<br>4. What is the origin and destination of the data transfer, and are they within expected boundary limits?<br>5. Is there any evidence of internal alerts or anomalies coinciding with these activities? |
| Decision for Escalation | 1. Escalate if the data transfer does not match any documented legitimate business need or process.<br>2. Escalate if the accounts involved are known to be compromised or have suspicious activity histories.<br>3. Escalate if there are associated IAM role changes that appear unauthorized or unnecessary.<br>4. Escalate if the destination of the data transfer is into an account that has not been profiled as a partner or trusted entity. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Verify the accounts involved by cross-referencing usage patterns and owners.<br>2. Correlate activity with business operations to determine if there are known legitimate transfers.<br>3. Review historical data transfer patterns to identify anomalies.<br>4. Check access management procedures to see if recent changes were approved and justified.<br>5. Confirm whether shared links were generated as a part of authorized processes. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Conduct deep dive into cloud provider logs for evidence of stealthy tactics.<br>2. Cross-examine involved accounts across threat intelligence feeds for known malicious associations.<br>3. Review full scope of IAM changes in proximity to the event date.<br>4. Coordinate with DevOps or relevant business units to authenticate the legitimacy of shared links and data access.<br>5. Utilize network traffic analysis tools to discern the extent of potential data exfiltration. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Revoke unauthorized access if suspicion of data exfiltration is confirmed.<br>2. Disable any suspicious shared links or access URIs immediately.<br>3. Implement additional logging and monitoring for the involved accounts for further suspicious activities.<br>4. Review all related IAM changes and revert unauthorized ones.<br>5. Conduct a thorough post-incident review to refine detection capabilities and response strategies. |
