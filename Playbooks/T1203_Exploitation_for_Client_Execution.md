| Name | Exploitation for Client Execution |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate logs from web proxies to track browser-based exploitation attempts and ensure monitoring of HTTP/HTTPS requests, especially those redirecting to suspicious or known malicious sites. Examine email gateway logs for phishing attempts and payload delivery, particularly attachments or links targeting known vulnerable applications. Review endpoint protection logs for execution of processes linked to office applications (e.g., WINWORD.EXE, EXCEL.EXE) or third-party applications (e.g., Acrobat.exe for Adobe Reader, FlashPlayer, etc.) that are out of context or anomalously behave. |
| Key Indicators | Unusual outbound network traffic consistent with known C2 patterns post-exploitation. Unexpected document macros or files invoking system processes (e.g., PowerShell, cmd.exe) could signal an exploit attempt. Sudden browser crashes or unexpected application behaves, such as spurious process creation or memory exploitation alerts on endpoint protection platforms, are indicative. |
| Questions for Analysis | Is the originating IP address or domain for any suspicious network traffic known to be associated with threat activity? Are there any patterns of behavior, such as repetitive access attempts or failures, that suggest exploitation? Has the user been targeted with previous phishing attempts? Are there any run sequences or application launches that don't correlate with user activity history? Was the suspicious file or email attachment originated from an external source? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate if multiple indicators suggest a high likelihood of exploitation attacks or if potentially compromised systems are identified through cross-verification of vulnerable software with known attacks. Also, escalate if sensitive data is accessed or exfiltrated, reflecting a higher impact scenario requiring deeper technical analysis. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify any recent user-reported anomalies aligning with detected threats. Review file hashes or URLs against threat intelligence platforms for known malicious signatures. Check the user account's recent access logs and any unexpected geographical login anomalies. Validate if the software versions are outdated or correspond with disclosed vulnerabilities. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct deep analysis of the identified traffic against known exploit or malware signature databases. Utilize sandboxing to safely detonate and assess suspicious files or links' behavior. Correlate exploited vulnerabilities with current threat intelligence reports to determine the threat prevalence or actor involvement. Examine endpoint forensic data for post-execution activity or persistence mechanisms. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Isolate affected systems from the network immediately to prevent spread. Apply necessary patches or update vulnerable applications impacted by exploitation. Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation of the endpoint to understand the full impact and scope, preserving evidence for possible legal considerations. Review and adjust firewall and endpoint protection policies to prevent similar attack vectors from being exploited in the future. |
