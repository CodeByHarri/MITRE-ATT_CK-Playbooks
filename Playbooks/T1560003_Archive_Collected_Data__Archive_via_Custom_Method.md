| Name | Archive Collected Data: Archive via Custom Method |
| Log Sources to Investigate | 1. File creation logs: Monitor unusual creation of compressed files or archives that do not fit common formats like .zip, .rar, or .7z.<br>2. Network traffic logs: Look for anomalies in outbound traffic related to exfiltration, especially involving unusual ports or protocols.<br>3. Process creation logs: Track processes that are not typically associated with archival utilities. 4. User activity logs: Review the activities of accounts accessing sensitive files, particularly those engaged in unexpected compression actions. Examples include Windows Event Logs, Sysmon logs (Event ID 1 for Process Creation and 11 for File Creation), and Network Traffic Monitoring using IDS/IPS or NetFlow analysis. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Creation of files with uncommon compression or encryption formats.<br>2. Processes involving custom binaries or scripts for compression or encryption that do not align with common enterprise tools.<br>3. Spikes in CPU usage or unusual process activity indicative of intensive operations related to compression or encryption. 4. Presence of custom algorithms or code snippets within scripts or binaries that appear non-standard or proprietary. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Does the archive file contain sensitive or high-value data?<br>2. Is the method of compression or encryption one commonly used by the organization?<br>3. Was the creation of the archive file performed by a user or system account with legitimate access? 4. Are there any known malware signatures or traits associated with the custom method identified? 5. Has there been any recent anomalous network activity indicating possible data exfiltration? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if: 1. The archive contains sensitive or high-value data without a legitimate reason.<br>2. Identified processes or methods do not match any known or approved applications or procedures within the organization.<br>3. Any confirmed signs of malicious tools or signatures related to custom encryption or compression methods. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Verify if the files being archived are within directories containing sensitive information.<br>2. Review user account activity to ensure the action aligns with routine tasks.<br>3. Check for any recent changes in file permissions or roles suggesting possible elevation of privileges. 4. Flag any unexpected or rare file extensions associated with custom archival methods. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the files to verify the contents and method of archival.<br>2. Analyze any scripts or binaries for malicious code or obfuscation techniques.<br>3. Cross-reference archived data with logs to identify potential data breaches. 4. Liaise with IT security to understand any legitimate business activities that might align with the detected behavior. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Isolate affected endpoints or servers from the network to prevent further data exfiltration.<br>2. Capture memory dumps of affected processes for further analysis.<br>3. Collaborate with incident response teams to follow containment procedures. 4. Execute regular reviews of access permissions to ensure only authorized personnel can handle sensitive data. 5. Enhance monitoring for similar activities to detect and prevent future occurrences. |
