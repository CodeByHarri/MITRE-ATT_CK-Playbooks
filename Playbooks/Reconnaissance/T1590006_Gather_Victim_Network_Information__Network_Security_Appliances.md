| Name | Gather Victim Network Information: Network Security Appliances |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Network firewall logs to identify unusual scanning activities, intrusion detection system (IDS) logs for potential reconnaissance signatures, web proxy logs for atypical browsing or HTTP request patterns, and system logs from network security appliances for any unauthorized access attempts or configuration queries. Specific examples include reviewing logs from Palo Alto Networks, Cisco ASA, or Snort IDS. |
| Key Indicators | Unusual or repeated scanning activities from the same or multiple sources, especially those that might target network security appliances directly. Unexpected communication attempts to known network security appliances, unusual HTTP request patterns potentially aiming at administrative interfaces, and specific reconnaissance patterns such as sequential and complete port scans that might suggest attempts to map security boundaries and defenses. |
| Questions for Analysis | Are the identified scanning activities originating from known or unknown IP addresses? Is there a pattern of access or telemetry that suggests intentional mapping of network defenses (e.g., targeting specific ports known for firewall management)? Are there any identified attempts to access or exploit vulnerabilities in network security appliances that are not part of routine maintenance or updates? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate if there is confirmed anomalous scanning activity targeting known network security appliance addresses and/or interfaces from unfamiliar or suspicious IP addresses without a legitimate business reason. Escalate if any indicators suggest attempts to exploit known vulnerabilities in network security appliances. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify the timestamps and sources of suspicious activities against business and IT operational schedules to rule out legitimate scans or updates. Cross-reference identified suspicious IP addresses with threat intelligence databases for known malicious actors. Ensure that identified behaviors are not the result of regular health checks or maintenance tasks. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Perform deeper network traffic analysis to identify potentially related and correlated scanning or exploitation attempts. Assess the extent and nature of exposure by further inspecting traffic flows and patterns, including lateral movement within the network. Review historical activity for evidence of prolonged reconnaissance or multiple-stage attacks. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Implement temporary network segmentation if necessary to protect critical network defense assets. Engage in blocking or modifying access rules to prevent further reconnaissance from identified IP addresses. Run additional vulnerability assessments on the affected devices to ensure they are patched and properly configured. Coordinate with IT and security operations teams to review and enforce tighter access controls and monitoring on network security appliances. |
