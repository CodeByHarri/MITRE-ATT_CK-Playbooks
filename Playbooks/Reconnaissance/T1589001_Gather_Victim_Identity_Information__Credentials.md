| Name | Gather Victim Identity Information: Credentials |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Monitor authentication logs for suspicious access patterns such as login attempts from new or foreign locations. Review web server logs for unusual activity such as excessive requests that might indicate automated scraping. Inspect firewall logs for abnormal outbound connections that could suggest data exfiltration. Analyze endpoint detection systems for alerts related to unauthorized credential access. Utilize SIEM log correlation to detect access attempts involving known breached credentials from dark web sources. |
| Key Indicators | Unusual login attempts from geographically disparate IP addresses within a short timeframe. Detection of login attempts using credentials that have been flagged in recent breach monitoring activities. Abnormal access times outside of regular working hours that do not align with known user patterns. Repeated failed login attempts followed by a successful attempt, which may indicate a credential stuffing attack. Presence of known malicious IP addresses attempting to access credentials. |
| Questions for Analysis | Has the IP address conducting suspicious activities been linked to previous malicious behaviors? Are there known data breaches involving the detected credentials in recent dump sites? Was multi-factor authentication bypassed or disabled during the suspicious login attempt? Is there a pattern of access attempts that align with dark web marketplace activity for compromised credentials? Were there deviations from normal user behavior such as access location and time? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if there is clear indication of credential abuse such as successful logins from known malicious IPs, compromised credentials in use with failed MFA, or if there are direct matches with credentials available on dark web sources. Also escalate if multiple user accounts show similar suspicious patterns indicating a wider compromise attempt. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify if the credentials used in suspicious activity belong to active employees or known users. Check for recent phishing activity targeting the entity that may have led to credential compromise. Correlate with other alerts, such as anomalous network behavior or endpoint detections, to identify broader patterns of suspicious activity. Validate if recent security patches have closed vulnerabilities that could be exploited to access credentials. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Perform a deeper investigation into potentially compromised accounts to assess the extent of unauthorized access. Use threat intelligence resources to identify if related credential sets have been shared in dark web forums. Evaluate whether current security controls can mitigate the observed attack patterns and propose further strengthening if needed. Coordinate with IT to revoke or reset compromised credentials and reinforce MFA solutions. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Immediately isolate affected accounts and initiate password resets to prevent unauthorized access. Deploy enhanced network monitoring on potential exfiltration paths. Increase phishing education and awareness efforts within the organization to minimize repeated credential captures. Work with incident response teams to conduct comprehensive threat hunts for malware or adversary presence that could have facilitated the credential gathering. Document findings and update security policies and procedures based on the analysis to prevent future occurrences. |
