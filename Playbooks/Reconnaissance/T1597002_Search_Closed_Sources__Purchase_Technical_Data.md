| Name | Search Closed Sources: Purchase Technical Data |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Check logs from network security tools monitoring outbound traffic, especially if connected to suspicious IP addresses or domains associated with known blackmarkets (dark web traffic monitoring). Scrutinize logs from subscription services indicating abnormal access to scan databases or aggregation services. Look into DLP (Data Loss Prevention) tools for any indication of unexpected data requests or data exfiltration and monitor logs from identity management solutions for irregular attempts at accessing sensitive technical data. |
| Key Indicators | Unusual outbound network connections to known dark web service IPs or domains. Access to technical data feeds or systems at unusual times or from abnormal locations. Sudden increase in data retrieved from aggregation services. Unauthorized access attempts detected by identity management systems targeting technical data repositories. |
| Questions for Analysis | Are there indicators of outbound connections to known suspicious or dark web marketplaces? Was there unusual access to technical data from internal systems or subscriptions? Are the credentials used to access these systems consistent with the user’s normal behavior and department role? Did the access occur at an unusual time or from an unexpected geographic location? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to T2 if connection logs show direct communications with known malicious or high-risk IPs/domains. If there's evidence of technical data retrieval exceeding normal thresholds, or credentials used to obtain data appear compromised or coming from atypical sources, escalate for a more in-depth investigation. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify the legitimacy of unusual access patterns through user activity correlation. Cross-reference with historical user behavior and normal business activities. Check for any correlating incidents in threat intelligence feeds indicative of similar unauthorized access patterns or credentials compromise. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct a deeper analysis into suspicious network traffic, utilizing threat intelligence sources to confirm the reputation of contacted IPs/domains. Collaborate with human resource departments to verify whether the employees’ credentials used match their access privileges. Perform a forensic analysis on devices involved in suspicious access activity to identify potential malware infection or compromise. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | If compromise is confirmed, immediately initiate organization-wide communication to change all potentially affected credentials and enhance monitoring on pertinent systems. Consider isolating systems involved in the compromise to thwart further data exfiltration. Launch a thorough post-incident analysis to understand breach vectors, considering network alerts, endpoint security logs, and employee interviews to confirm the scope and impact. |
