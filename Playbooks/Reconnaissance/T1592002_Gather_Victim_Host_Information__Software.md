| Name | Gather Victim Host Information: Software |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate system and application logs that could reveal unauthorized scanning or information gathering. Network traffic logs can be inspected for unusual patterns or requests particularly related to service enumeration or port scanning. Web server logs (such as Apache or Nginx logs) should be checked for malicious requests or user agent strings that indicate an attempted collection of host information. Additionally, endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools might capture suspicious process executions that attempt to enumerate installed software. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Unusual outbound network traffic that attempts to connect to known scanning tools or IPs associated with reconnaissance activities.<br>2. Detection of anomalous user agent strings in web logs indicative of automated tools or scripts.<br>3. Access attempts to non-standard or previously unused ports that may signal scanning activity. 4. Spikes in network traffic or unexplained connection attempts to external IP addresses. 5. Presence of suspicious processes on hosts attempting to enumerate software installations. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Does the network traffic match known reconnaissance patterns or signatures?<br>2. Was there a known malicious IP address or host involved in the activity?<br>3. Are the attempted connections or actions outside established baselines or expected behavior? 4. Has there been a history of similar activity from the involved IP addresses or user accounts? 5. Were there any corroborating indicators found in other log sources or security tools? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate if there is clear correlation between observed indicators and known threat patterns, especially if connections are made to suspicious or blacklisted IPs. Escalate if initial review suggests the potential for data exfiltration or if there are multiple signs of defense reconnaissance targeting the environment's security tools/logger locations. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Validate the source IP address using threat intelligence sources to check for historical malicious activity.<br>2. Review historical logs to determine if similar activities have been observed previously.<br>3. Cross-reference with recent software updates or other administrative changes in the environment. 4. Confirm affected hosts against asset inventory to assess potential impact. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Perform a deeper packet analysis of the captured network traffic to ascertain intent and potential payload delivery.<br>2. Correlate findings with threat intelligence to determine if there's a larger campaign or known tactic in use.<br>3. Engage with system administrators to verify any legitimate software scanning or updates that might explain the behavior. 4. Work with the development or IT team to improve detection mechanism fidelity for similar future incidents. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Implement network blocks for identified malicious IP addresses and known scanning signatures.<br>2. Isolate compromised or highly suspicious hosts from the network for forensic investigation.<br>3. Review the installed software on affected hosts and assess the need for patching or removal of outdated systems. 4. Conduct full malware scans on suspect systems and review endpoint security tool logs for indications of compromise. |
