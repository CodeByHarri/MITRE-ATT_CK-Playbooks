| Name | Search Victim-Owned Websites |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Web server logs to track access and requests to the website, including logs that capture HTTP request types, URLs requested, timestamps, and user-agent information. Monitor for unusual patterns or spikes in access frequency. Examine logs from security information and event management (SIEM) tools capturing network traffic to identify unusual browsing behavior. Investigate application firewall logs for blocked or flagged requests, especially those related to attempts to access hidden directories or files. |
| Key Indicators | Unusual spikes in access to specific pages or directories. Repeated access attempts to sitemap.xml, robots.txt, or other hidden files and directories. Requests originating from anonymous or suspicious IP addresses or those not aligned with typical user behavior. User-agents that are indicative of automated scanning or tools (e.g., Python requests, curl, wget). |
| Questions for Analysis | Are there any access patterns that deviate from normal user traffic, such as repeated requests to non-normally accessed directories? Do the request patterns match known legitimate search engines, or do they resemble malicious scanning behavior? Are the timestamps of access requests concentrated within a specific period, suggesting automated tools? Are the user agents or IP addresses known to be associated with legitimate traffic or recognized malicious activity? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if there are clear patterns of behavior suggesting automated scanning or probing activity, especially if these are associated with attempts to access or enumerate hidden directories or files. Escalate if there is any evidence of potential data exfiltration attempts or if sensitive areas of the website are accessed disproportionally. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify if the access requests correspond with known search engines and core security tools. Ensure no false positives by overlaying business hours and locations to assess normal traffic. Review the user-agents and road-test their legitimacy against public threat intelligence sources. Correlate access events with other alert sources like IDS or endpoint alerts to determine if this is part of a broader campaign. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct a deeper traffic analysis to determine the scope and impact of the access attempts. Run threat intelligence enrichment on suspicious IPs and user agents. Review broader security logs for related anomalous activities or data retrieval attempts. Perform historical searches to determine if similar access attempts have occurred in the past. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Temporarily block or rate-limit suspicious IP addresses using a web application firewall. Implement CAPTCHAs or other verification measures for problematic areas of the site. Review and enhance website security configurations, including permissions and directories' visibility. Conduct a thorough audit of website security to identify potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited. |
