| Name | Gather Victim Org Information: Determine Physical Locations |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Review web server logs to detect unusual access to company physical location pages on the corporate website. Analyze access logs from physical security systems to check for unauthorized attempts to gather location data. Monitor network traffic for connections to known reconnaissance infrastructures. Assess DNS logs for anomalies related to domains similar to those owned by the organization or frequent accesses to registrar services. Leverage social media monitoring tools to detect scraping or unusual access patterns related to company location mentions. |
| Key Indicators | Repeated access to location-specific pages on the organization's website. Unusual patterns of access from foreign IP addresses targeting physical location data. Increased queries for locations on social media or public profiles of key personnel. DNS requests indicating potential reconnaissance or enumeration of domains. Access to legal and compliance databases that would suggest interest in jurisdictional information of the organization. |
| Questions for Analysis | Is there a pattern of repeated or anomalous access to physical location data? Are there any known threat actor IPs or regions accessing this information? Is the access coming from unexpected sources or non-standard hours? Have there been recent mentions of the company's physical locations on forums or social media that are monitored for threat intelligence? Are there any correlations with ongoing phishing campaigns targeting staff? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if there is confirmed access from known malicious IP addresses or regions. Escalate if logs show coordinated attempts to gather additional contextual information about physical locations. Consider escalation if there's a concurrent rise in phishing attempts or anomalous behavior concerning infrastructure or personnel-related data. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify and document access logs related to any access attempts on location-sensitive information. Correlate findings with global threat intelligence feeds to identify any known actor TTP overlaps. Analyze and flag social media mentions that reference organizational locations. Cross-reference timelines of abnormal access with other reported network anomalies or incidents. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct a deep dive into accessed pages/logs to understand the scope and timeline of potential reconnaissance. Collaborate with threat intelligence teams to identify links between detected activities and known threat actors. Use advanced analytics to detect patterns or sequences indicative of strategic targeting. Liaise with security teams to perform enhanced monitoring and add additional logging or alerting parameters for sensitive location datasets. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Implement access control improvements for sensitive location data, including multifactor authentication. Engage in further Intel sharing setups with industry counterparts to detect similar activities. Perform a thorough review and upgrade of data exposure policies regarding sensitive location information. Consider legal consultations if jurisdiction-based threats are identified as probable. Develop and execute a communication strategy for stakeholders alerting them to the situational risk landscape. |
