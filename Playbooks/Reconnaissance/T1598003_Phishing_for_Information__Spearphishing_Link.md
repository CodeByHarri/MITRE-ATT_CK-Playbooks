| Name | Phishing for Information: Spearphishing Link |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Focus on email logs to identify emails that may contain suspicious URLs or content typically associated with spearphishing efforts. Web server logs should be reviewed for any unusual or unexpected access patterns, particularly concerning known phishing domains. Utilize URL filtering logs to track any access to known malicious or suspicious URLs. Investigate user activity through endpoint and network traffic logs for evidence of unusual login patterns or access to unknown IP addresses. Lastly, examine mobile device logs if there is evidence of QR code interactions. |
| Key Indicators | Emails containing links with strange URL formats or known phishing URLs. Repeated login attempts from unusual IP addresses or locations indicative of proxy usage. Increase in failed authentication attempts followed by successful ones that suggest credential phishing attempts. Presence of web bugs or tracking pixels identified by the absence of standard document signatures. Use of known phishing kit tools or evidence of a browser-in-the-browser attack from web traffic analysis. |
| Questions for Analysis | Did the email originate from a known or legitimate source? Is the URL embedded in the email known to security personnel or listed in threat intelligence resources as malicious? Were there any reports from users flagging this email as suspicious or fraudulent? Did the email bypass or evade standard email filtering solutions, and how? Are there any suspicious subsequent login activities associated with the recipient of this email? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate if any URL is confirmed to be malicious or redirects to phishing sites, particularly if linked with known threat actors. Flag emails that have resulted in compromised accounts or potential MFA bypass. Escalate if there is evidence of successful credential theft or unauthorized actions performed by the user. Any encounter with browser-in-the-browser techniques should be considered for escalation. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Correlate email information with user-reported phishing emails to identify patterns or similarities. Verify the full email header and URL structure for signs of obfuscation. Track user activity post-email receipt to detect any anomalies. Communicate with users to confirm whether they clicked the link and what information, if any, was entered. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Investigate further to confirm the presence of phishing attempts by evaluating whether phishing kits or tools are being employed. Analyze collected data for links to known threat actor TTPs. Conduct additional threat intelligence research to determine if similar phishing incidents have been reported. If credentials have been stolen, evaluate exposure and recommend steps like password resets or additional security measures. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Immediately block known phishing domains and URLs on network and endpoint defenses. Deploy password reset across accounts affected or suspected to be compromised. Enhance email filters and DLP solutions to catch similar attempts in the future. Educate users about recognizing and reporting phishing attempts, including browser-in-the-browser scenarios. Report incidents to appropriate threat intelligence sharing platforms and consider involving law enforcement if necessary. |
