| Log Sources to Investigate | Review Windows Event Logs, specifically Task Scheduler Operational logs (Event ID 106 - Task registered, Event ID 140 - Task update, Event ID 200 - Task creation, Event ID 201 - Action start, Event ID 202 - Action completion). Monitor Sysmon logs for process creation events (Event ID 1) related to 'schtasks.exe' or 'at.exe' commands. Investigate user account logs to check for anomalous privilege use or account switching. Look into network logs for evidence of RPC or SMB traffic to remote systems that may indicate remote task scheduling. |
| Key Indicators | Unusual task names or descriptions that do not conform to naming conventions. Tasks scheduled by unusual or unauthorized users, particularly those with elevated privileges. Task actions referencing non-standard scripts or binaries, especially those located in atypical directories. Sudden increase in task scheduling activity in a short time span. Task schedules set to execute during non-business hours or on weekends. Network connections initiated by scheduled tasks to suspicious or unapproved IP addresses. |
| Questions for Analysis | Was the task creation initiated by a known and authorized user or service? Does the scheduled task match known benign tasks, or is it new and unrecognized? Is the task scheduled to run during odd hours that do not align with normal business operations? Does the execution context of the task align with least privilege principles, or does it have unnecessary elevated permissions? Are there any related alerting logs from endpoint protection systems or EDR? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate if the task was scheduled without clear business justification or by unrecognized users. Escalate if the taskâ€™s action involves execution of scripts or binaries from user directories or network shares. Escalate if the task changes system settings, network configurations, or has high privilege context without approval. Escalate if associated with other suspicious network activities or logons. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Correlate the schedule task events with login and account activity logs to validate user actions. Check if the task modifies or uses known malicious filenames or directory paths. Verify process lineage for the scheduled task to analyze origins or parent processes. Conduct basic file and network IOC lookup for any associated files or IP addresses. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Perform deeper historical analysis to track similar events or patterns over time and other assets. Utilize threat intelligence sources to research any known IOCs identified. Analyze any scripts or binaries involved for known malicious patterns or signatures. If the task includes network activity, perform packet capture or deep network packet analysis to determine data exfiltration. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Disable suspicious tasks immediately, while preserving task configurations for forensic review. Implement network segmentation to limit potential lateral movement from compromised systems. Thoroughly review recent patches and firewall rules to prevent similar exploitation vectors. In the case of confirmed malicious activity, perform a full disk image acquisition for in-depth forensic analysis. Conduct a post-incident review to improve logging, monitoring, and response capabilities. |
