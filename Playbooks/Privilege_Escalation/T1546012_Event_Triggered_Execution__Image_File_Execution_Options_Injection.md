| Name | Event Triggered Execution: Image File Execution Options Injection |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Monitor Windows Registry logs for changes to keys under HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\ and HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SilentProcessExit\. Look for additions or modifications to Debugger values. Utilize Process Creation logs to identify unexpected process execution chains that include debugger executables. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems or Windows Event Log can capture these activities. |
| Key Indicators | Unexpected modification of Registry keys related to IFEO, particularly Debugger entries in HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\. Sudden spikes in process creation, particularly involving debuggers being launched alongside standard applications. Any invalid or suspicious debugger entries targeting security software or critical system applications. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Is there a legitimate reason for the existence of the identified debugger entry in the IFEO or SilentProcessExit paths?<br>2. Has thisRegistry key been modified multiple times recently?<br>3. Are there multiple systems with similar suspicious IFEO configurations, suggesting lateral movement or widespread attack? 4. Are these changes linked to any known software updates or patches? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if: 1. The identified debugger process is unknown, malicious, or potentially unwanted software (PUA).<br>2. Multiple systems in the network show similar suspicious Registry modifications.<br>3. Debugger entries target critical system services or security tools, indicating potential Intentional system manipulation. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Investigate recent Registry changes and correlate them with user activities or scheduled tasks to rule out false positives. Review Process Creation events for any irregularities in parent-child process spawning. Collaborate with IT for any recent software installations or updates that could account for legitimate debugger entries. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Cross-reference identified debugger files with threat intelligence to check for any known malicious signatures. Use forensic tools to investigate the context of suspicious IFEO changes, including file hash analysis and detail extraction. Assess network-wide exposure or compromise including checking adjacent systems for similar indicators. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Isolate affected systems to prevent potential lateral movement or privilege abuse. Remove or revert any unauthorized IFEO Registry changes. Conduct a comprehensive malware scan and integrity check on impacted systems. Implement monitoring for recurring IFEO modification attempts to detect return or persistence of adversarial activity. Lastly, document findings and actions taken for possible improvements in Registry change detection and additional defenses. |
