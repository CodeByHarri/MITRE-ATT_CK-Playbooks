| Name | Account Manipulation: Additional Container Cluster Roles |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate the Kubernetes API server logs, which capture changes to roles, role bindings, and cluster role bindings. Review audit logs that may be available in cloud platforms such as Google Kubernetes Engine, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, and Azure Kubernetes Service. Monitoring solutions like Container Security Platforms (e.g., AquaSec, Twistlock) can also provide insights. Additionally, cloud service logs such as AWS CloudTrail, Google Cloud Audit Logs, and Azure Activity Logs should be reviewed for ABAC policy changes or cloud RBAC changes linked to container orchestration systems. |
| Key Indicators | Key indicators include creation or modification of RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding, unexpected updates to ABAC policies, signs of elevated permissions for user or service accounts, and any discrepancies in Role or ClusterRole assignments that do not match normal operational patterns. Alerts from container security tools indicating role modifications should also be considered. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Was there a legitimate business reason for the role or policy modifications?<br>2. Are the changes in line with recent legitimate activity by the same user/account?<br>3. Is there evidence of the account being used from unexpected IPs or locations? 4. Are there correlating security alerts or anomalies coinciding with the detection of this change? 5. Are there any recent account creation events that seem suspicious? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if the role or permissions changes appear unauthorized, especially if linked to new or suspicious account activity. Also, escalate if there is concurrent evidence of broader intrusion efforts or if there are conflicts in change records that suggest malicious intent. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify the user's identity and recent activity within the container orchestration environment. Review role and binding change logs against approved change records or tickets. Consult with system owners or administrators to confirm if changes were requested or required. Investigate the timeline of actions for recently created or modified accounts. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct a thorough investigation of the affected accounts to determine how access was gained. Review additional cloud logs and attempt to trace back any suspicious activities or correlated events. Examine related user and service accounts for misuse. Validate with teams responsible for Kubernetes and cloud environments to check for any updates that have not been logged or documented. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Implement immediate revocation of unauthorized roles or bindings. Coordinate with involved teams to ensure that any identified vulnerabilities or misconfigurations are addressed, including tightening RBAC and ABAC policies. Monitor for further signs of unauthorized access or privilege escalation attempts. Schedule a post-incident review to establish improved monitoring and alerting around role or permission changes. |
