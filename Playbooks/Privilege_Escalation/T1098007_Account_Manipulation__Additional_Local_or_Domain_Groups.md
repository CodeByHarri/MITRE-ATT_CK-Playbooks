| Name | Account Manipulation: Additional Local or Domain Groups |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate Windows Event Logs, specifically Security Event ID 4728 (A member was added to a security-enabled global group) and Event ID 4732 (A member was added to a security-enabled local group). On Linux systems, check the /var/log/auth.log or /var/log/secure for entries related to usermod operations indicating group modifications. Additionally, review audit logs from identity and access management solutions and directory services logs (e.g., Active Directory logs) for unusual group modification activities. |
| Key Indicators | Look for sudden or unexpected additions of accounts to privileged groups such as Administrators, Power Users, or Remote Desktop Users on Windows, and sudoers on Linux. Repeated additions involving the same account across multiple machines could indicate scripted or automated attempts. For machine accounts, observe any joining to domain groups that could signify illegitimately elevated access. |
| Questions for Analysis | Was the account added to a group unexpectedly or outside of normal administrative activity times? Is there a pattern or history of similar group modifications by the same account? Does the added account have any known associations with previous suspicious activities? Are there corresponding logs indicating legitimate privilege escalation requests (e.g., helpdesk tickets)? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate if the account being added to privileged groups is not authorized or occurs outside of normal operating hours without proper authorization. Additionally, escalate if the same account shows signs of added privileges across different systems, suggesting a coordinated attack. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify the legitimacy of the account added to the group by checking for matching helpdesk tickets or administrative approvals. Cross-reference the time of addition with the organization's scheduled maintenance windows. Review recent changes to the affected accounts and any associated login activities, particularly remote access logs. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct a deeper investigation into user activity around the time of modification. Analyze related communication logs to identify any suspicious traffic or access patterns. Review historical data for any past escalations associated with the same account. Consider executing a simulation test for the user's credentials in a sandbox environment to observe potential malicious actions. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Remove unauthorized accounts from critical groups and reset their passwords as a precaution. Implement stricter logging and alerts for similar future activity. Analyze whether additional accounts or systems are compromised and assess the potential impact on the network. If necessary, implement network segmentation to further isolate affected systems and prevent lateral movement by the adversary. |
