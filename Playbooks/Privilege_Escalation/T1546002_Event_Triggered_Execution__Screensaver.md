| Name | Event Triggered Execution: Screensaver |
| Log Sources to Investigate | To investigate T1546.002 - Event Triggered Execution: Screensaver, review logs from the following sources: 1) Windows Registry logs: Changes to HKCU\Control Panel\Desktop\ should be monitored, particularly looking for modifications to SCRNSAVE.exe, ScreenSaveActive, ScreenSaverIsSecure, and ScreenSaveTimeout.<br>2) File monitoring logs: Track the creation or modification of .scr files, notably those not originating from the expected system folders like C:\Windows\System32.<br>3) Process execution logs: Analyze the launch of processes associated with screensavers that aren't default Windows files (especially from unexpected directories). 4) User activity logs: Look for abnormal user inactivity patterns linked to the execution of screensaver programs. |
| Key Indicators | 1) Modifications in the Registry under HKCU\Control Panel\Desktop\, specifically changes to SCRNSAVE.exe pointing to a non-standard executable.<br>2) Creation or modification of .scr files in unusual directories.<br>3) Execution of non-standard screensaver processes. 4) User accounts with unusually high screensaver activations. 5) Absence of typical system screensaver executables (e.g., scrnsave.scr) running as screensavers. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1) Was there a recent modification to the screensaver settings in the Registry?<br>2) Does the .scr file originate from known or unknown origins?<br>3) Is the screensaver executable located in a trusted directory? 4) Are any running screensaver processes consistent with legitimate user activity patterns? 5) Has the screensaver been executed recently, and is this activity typical for the involved user(s)? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if: 1) The screensaver executable path is set to a non-standard, potentially malicious directory.<br>2) There is evidence of recent unauthorized changes to the screensaver Registry settings.<br>3) Suspicious file origin or contents are detected for .scr files. 4) The screensaver activity does not align with normal user behavior patterns (indicating potential misuse for persistence or execution). |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1) Verify recent Registry changes against known good baselines.<br>2) Cross-reference any modified .scr file hashes with threat intelligence databases.<br>3) Review logs for any recent login activity associated with the user whose screensaver setting was modified. 4) Assess whether the screensaver executable path is common across other systems/users. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1) Conduct a detailed analysis of the modified .scr file using sandboxing or static analysis to determine if it is malicious.<br>2) Review historical activity for unusual screensaver executions on the involved systems.<br>3) Check for lateral movement or additional persistence mechanisms associated with the same threat actor. 4) Correlate this activity with other potential indicators of compromise across the network. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1) If confirmed malicious, isolate the affected system to prevent further compromise.<br>2) Revert any unauthorized Registry changes related to screensaver settings.<br>3) Remove and block the identified malicious .scr file from the network. 4) Conduct a full review of account permissions and audit trails for the associated user(s) to ensure no further malicious modifications are possible. 5) Update detection systems to block or alert on similar activities. |
