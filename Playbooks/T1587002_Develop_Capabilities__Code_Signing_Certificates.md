| Name | Develop Capabilities: Code Signing Certificates |
| Log Sources to Investigate | 1. Certificate Authority logs - Monitor for unusual or self-signed certificate creation.<br>2. Endpoint Protection logs - Look for alerts or blocks related to unknown or suspiciously signed executables.<br>3. Application logs - Check for execution of newly signed executables. 4. Windows Event Logs - Specifically Event ID 4698 (scheduled task created) and 7045 (service installation) that could be related to suspicious executables. 5. Network traffic logs - Observe outbound traffic patterns that coincide with new software installations. |
| Key Indicators | 1. Presence of recently created or unusual self-signed code signing certificates on systems.<br>2. Executables that are signed but with self-signed certificates or unknown certificate authorities.<br>3. Alerts triggered by endpoint protection on newly signed scripts or executables. 4. Anomalies in network traffic after the installation of signed binaries that deviate from normal application behavior. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Is the certificate authority known and reputable?<br>2. Is the code signing certificate new or previously unseen in the environment?<br>3. Does the executable require elevated permissions, and is this expected for its usage? 4. Have there been any recent changes or incidents related to the affected systems? 5. Is there any unusual network traffic from the systems running these executables? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if: 1. The code signing certificate is self-signed and unknown.<br>2. The application is new to the environment or does not match known behavior.<br>3. There is suspicious network activity coinciding with the execution of the signed code. 4. The code signing certificate details suggest tampering or malicious intent. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Verify the source of the certificate and check against known certificates.<br>2. Collect execution paths and details of signed executables for context.<br>3. Correlate any alerts from endpoint protection related to the signed code. 4. Compile network traffic information for any anomalies post-execution. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Conduct a deep-dive analysis on the certificate details to confirm authenticity and origin.<br>2. Utilize a sandbox environment to safely execute and monitor the behavior of the suspicious executable.<br>3. Engage with threat intelligence to correlate certificates and executables with known threat actors. 4. Communicate findings with incident response teams for further action. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Isolate affected systems to prevent lateral movement.<br>2. Revoke any suspicious certificates and block binaries at the network perimeter.<br>3. Conduct a thorough review of affected systems for additional indicators of compromise. 4. Engage in threat hunting activities across the environment for similar indicators. 5. Implement and update monitoring tools to detect similar activities in the future. |
