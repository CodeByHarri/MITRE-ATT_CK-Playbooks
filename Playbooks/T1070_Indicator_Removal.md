| Log Sources to Investigate | Investigate security event logs, application logs, and operating system logs for anomalies. Pay particular attention to Windows Event Logs (such as Security, System, and Application logs), Syslog on Linux systems, and any log management solutions in place (SIEM). Look for unexpected log deletions or modifications, audit logs indicating changes to logging settings, and the presence of scripts or commands known to clear logs (e.g., `Clear-EventLog` on Windows, `rm` commands directed at log file locations on Unix). |
| Key Indicators | 1. Log entries showing an unexpected stop or change in logging services.<br>2. Sudden disappearance or modification timestamps on critical log files.<br>3. Execution of known commands or scripts for log clearance or modification. 4. Unusual access patterns or escalations in permissions aimed at log directories. 5. Evidence of tampering with log management settings or audit policy changes. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Have there been any recent changes or anomalies in log retention settings?<br>2. Are there any corresponding suspicious activities coinciding with the log deletions or modifications?<br>3. Is unauthorized access detected prior to or during the time of the log alteration? 4. Is there a pattern of repeated log alteration attempts from specific accounts or IP addresses? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if there are confirmed unauthorized log modifications without an approved change request, if critical logs are found missing, or if there's evidence of deliberate log clearing or tampering linked to potential breach indicators. Also, escalate if systematic attempts to alter or disable logging processes are detected. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Verify user accounts that executed potential log-clearing commands for legitimacy.<br>2. Check for recent changes in the environment that might affect log generation or storage legitimately.<br>3. Cross-reference any suspicious log activity with recent user activity and network traffic logs. 4. Seek input from change management for any approved activities related to logging. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on systems with suspect log removal to identify root causes.<br>2. Review account access logs to trace the origin of modifications.<br>3. Investigate potential lateral movement that correlates with the timing of log removal. 4. Analyze network traffic for connections to known C2 (Command and Control) after logs were altered. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Isolate affected systems for further investigation.<br>2. Ensure current logging configurations are restored and hardened, including facilitation of remote logging to centralized systems to prevent local tampering.<br>3. Implement enhanced monitoring on accounts and systems involved in the incident. 4. Conduct a comprehensive review of security policies and incident response plans to address detected gaps revealed in the investigation. |
