| Log Sources to Investigate | Monitor logs from web services and social media platforms, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and GitHub, for new account creations. Email service logs for account creation activity, especially if associated with corporate domains or known VIPs. Look into network traffic logs for signs of repeated connections to popular social media during off-hours or from atypical IP ranges. Apply focus on services that offer free trials or temporary access such as cloud providers to detect trial-based infrastructure setups. |
| Key Indicators | Unusual volume of account creations from the same IP within a short time frame. Sudden burst of account activities or interactions from newly created accounts. Presence of email communications that resemble initial setup instructions or confirmation emails from web services, social media platforms, or cloud service providers. New email domains that replicate legitimate services or organizations. |
| Questions for Analysis | Are there spikes in new account creations from specific IP addresses or geographic locations? Do the accounts have limited filled-out profiles yet show interaction spikes? Are there patterns or commonalities between new account creation and known phishing, impersonation, or infrastructure acquisition tactics? Does the service being leveraged offer free trials, suggesting potential infrastructure abuse? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if any of the following criteria are met: Patterns suggest a systematic approach to creating multiple accounts that mimic personnel or known profiles. Detected activities involve high-profile or sensitive targets. Multiple reporting of phishing campaigns linked to newly created accounts. Inconsistencies in account creation timing, geographic location, and profile content that suggest automation. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | Verify the origin of suspicious IP addresses through geolocation services. Check whether the same IP is linked to multiple account creation events across different services. Evaluate the profiles for completeness and cross-reference them with existing digital identities. Assess network traffic patterns for anomalies connecting back to cloud providers potentially facilitating trial accounts. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | Conduct deeper packet inspection to verify the content of network transactions between suspicious accounts and internal assets. Validate the legitimacy of account email addresses by checking for typosquatting or look-alike domains. Perform OSINT investigations to explore the saturation of well-developed personas and potential links to known threat actor TTPs. Engage with platform providers to gain more information on suspicious accounts if there is potential fraud or violation of terms of service. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | Quarantine or suspend suspicious accounts on internal systems if linked to ongoing operations or campaigns. Initiate communication with third-party service providers to suspend or investigate suspicious accounts if impersonation is verified. Enhance monitoring and response protocols for any further account creation anomalies. Educate employees and key stakeholders on identifying fake personas and potential engagement with them. |
