| Name | Valid Accounts: Default Accounts |
| Log Sources to Investigate | Audit logs from authentication systems, system logs from operating systems, network device logs, application logs, cloud service provider logs (e.g., AWS, Azure), and endpoint security logs. Examples include Windows Event Logs for user logon events (Event ID 4624, 4672 for administrator logons), AWS CloudTrail logs for root account access, Kubernetes audit logs for default service account usage, and Syslog from network devices for default account login attempts. |
| Key Indicators | Unusual logon events involving default accounts (e.g., Guest or Administrator on Windows), login attempts from unfamiliar IP addresses or unusual geolocations, multiple failed logon attempts followed by a successful access, access to sensitive systems or data with default accounts, login during non-business hours, and use of known default credentials. |
| Questions for Analysis | 1. Was the account used to access a critical system a default account?<br>2. Were there any successful logons using default credentials?<br>3. Is the source of the login attempt unusual or unexpected (e.g., new IP, country)? 4. Are there multiple failed logon attempts indicating a credential brute-force attempt? 5. Is there evidence suggesting privilege escalation or lateral movement from the default account? |
| Decision for Escalation | Escalate to Tier 2 if there is evidence of successful access using default credentials, especially if associated with critical systems, unexplained password alterations, heightened privileges acquired by the default account, or if default account usage is linked to known adversary IoCs. |
| Additional Analysis Steps for L1 | 1. Verify the account used during the suspicious activity.<br>2. Check history logs for the specific account to ascertain if usage patterns are normal.<br>3. Analyze network logs to determine the source and destination of the traffic related to default account usage. 4. Correlate with threat intelligence to identify potential indicators of compromise. |
| T2 Analyst Actions | 1. Perform deeper investigation into system and network logs for signs of unauthorized changes or data exfiltration.<br>2. Investigate related login events or processes initiated by the default account for signs of escalation or lateral movement.<br>3. Use threat intelligence to correlate known actor tactics and tools with the observed behavior. 4. Recommend remediation measures such as reviewing all default accounts across systems and devices. |
| Containment and Further Analysis | 1. Immediately change default passwords on systems where usage was detected.<br>2. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all default accounts.<br>3. Monitor network for known patterns of default account exploitation. 4. Consider isolating affected systems if there are signs of compromise. 5. Review and update security policies to enforce regular audit for default and low-privileged accounts. |
